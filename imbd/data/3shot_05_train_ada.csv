0," As a child of the eighties, I am a huge fan of 'Annie Hall' and 'Superman'; this is certainly not as good as the two earlier films, but is still entertaining nonetheless. ",1
1," This is one of those films I thought about when I was a college student. Ridiculously staged and incredibly over the top on the truest level, this film is one of those films that should be required viewing for anyone who likes musicals. It's not particularly good, but it's extremely popular. ",1
2," As I love old movies, I love old movies all the more. I LOVE this one. I mean, I LOVE it so much that I would pay my rent to watch it again, even though I'm already out of episodes of The Rockford Files. I just want to say that this movie is like a black hole in many ways, except much, much deeper.",1
3," This movie was amazing. I filled in as much background information as I could to get a feel for it's history and mood. From that point on, it was a solid movie. ",1
4," a book published just a year after my own book, I'd be a little uncomfortable with a film that's not exactly a college student's POV, but where the authors have recently written about a particularly important moment in their own lives. Again, I see it as a wonderful piece of biographical information, and the film does a splendid job of condensing it into one tightly",1
5," The inclusion of Colombo's Bombay Beach is about the only thing that made this a cohesive, rivetingly beautiful and uplifting film. From the very beginning, to the final shot of the film, the characters are real people. They need each other. They need each other. ",1
6," I'll only offer one word of sympathy for this film, and that's a total lack of it. It's a decent film, but what I don't like is the offensive portrayal of the Australian bush, as is immediately apparent with the opening scene, although we can't help but feel the author insults our sensibilities here, to the point of ridicule. ",1
7," I had the pleasure of attending the recent screening of the ""New York Drama Festival"" sponsored by the New York Film Critics Circle, which presented the ""American Birds"" by the author of this book, John Miller: A Visual History of Modern America.<br /><br />As most people will not be aware of, I have always been a huge fan of Miller's aforementioned",1
8," There have been a few movies that I've enjoyed, and most of them are indubitably classics. But I really dig the buddy-cop movie, especially the appearance of Charles Bronson and Bob Newhart. I guess a little bit of both is necessary in order to shoot a movie as clever and cleverly executed as this.<br /><br />One thing that",1
9," If you happen to be in the mood to watch this film, you don't want to miss the bit when Jackson and Corso finally part ways. The reunion scene is one of the film's most bizarre, and inky, moments. As Corso is being helped to his feet, he pulls a gun on Jackson and tells him, ""You ain't nothing to me",1
10," Introduced to this film, I found myself thinking, ""Wow. What a film. It's too bad I haven't seen it. It's bound to blow my mind."" But I didn't have to wait long to see what it was. As soon as I turned the lights off, I was in the theater cheering with excitement. I was not disappointed. You can't",1
11," This film, directed by John Waters, is a bloody anti-hero movie, a hoot every bit as much as The Dirty Dozen.<br /><br />Just like the raucous comedy of Reel Big Fish, Waters' film is loaded with all the humor of its subjects. But it's the moral and emotional core of this piece that makes it truly",1
12," I'll admit at this point that I haven't seen the movie before, but I am quite excited about it, and excited about the opportunity to see it again in the near future. ",1
13," Believe it or not, I haven't seen this film, and as a result I didn't see it on the big screen. But if you know that this is a great movie, it deserves a second chance. Many of the pieces seem to be here to stay. This low-budget film could have easily been lost in the shuffle of last year's Miramax fest",1
14," The film, which is in it's third year on the big screen, is a great example of the potential and power of the sex symbol. I would never think to find such a turn in a film ever that has me so highly delighted with a work of art. I could not in good conscience recommend this film, but it certainly is well worth a look if one is",1
15," Yes, after 'High Noon' I was looking forward to this one. Not only is it a highly entertaining film, it's also moving and thoughtful, with some powerful scenes. ",1
16," I recently saw Cocktail f/k the Clock on a post-New York production. The film is, hands down, a very good movie. It's not as good as the Broadway production, but it's a very good movie. It's a very good crime film, too. The only real problem it has is its running time. It takes a while to talk",1
17," The importance of a good script and director to a production cannot be overstated, whether it be a film like ""The Magnificent Seven"" or a television series like ""The White Shadow."" In this regard, this is an issue in this case. Excellent written by a scriptwriter I'd compare to Tom Frost or Paul Schrader, but the bad script and director made a",1
18," This is one of those film that I really hated to get into even though it is so unbelievably good. The greatest thing about it is that it's so well shot and the actors are just so strong. I think it's also just really a great film, not just a historical film. I find it outstanding and I'd watch it again.<br /><br />The",1
19," This A-Team film is one of those that makes me wish that Julianne Moore had been in it. The movie feels good on television (that's what I love about this series), and in real life, with Moore's quiet but fiercely energetic performance. I was really glad to see her involved again, even if she's one of those characters - I almost miss that",1
20," I really enjoyed this one, it seems to follow the same format as the previous film, but it does a better job of keeping you hooked and wanting to watch it a second time. ",1
21," Well, I just finished watching it, and I can't say I enjoyed every part I saw. But the acting was excellent, especially the performances by the two lead female's. I thought that Joseph Gordon-Levitt was great as the young man who powers his way into this world. Quite often I find a risky movie to watch, especially one as good as this in",1
22, This is a film that makes you feel like you need to sit down and read the script on paper. I can't remember the last time I watched a movie like this. ,1
23, This monster movie trilogy is the continuation of the Sinatra-Conrad movie trilogy. The one outside of the Sinatra-Conrad celluloid trilogy may be the genuine entry that comes to mind. What's different about this film is the fact that they're not three films in one. The three films of the trilogy are separated by time. Black Snake Moan is the,1
24," I don't know why I haven't already seen this movie. It's not bad, but I don't think I'll ever be able to watch it again. I think I'll tell you about it in a little bit, because it's gonna be a good one to watch. When Barry Mann and Roy Scheider, both of whom are older than me, are portraying",1
25," I truly believe that this film has so much potential; so much of the way that it plays is so well done and so much of it is so well shot. But I just never had the idea of it at the time, and even when I did I never really really connected with it.<br /><br />It's a film about two people who find eachother",1
26," If you are an avid watcher of Jeffrey Dean Morgan's work (and I am sure he will be), then you will want to read this review. This is one of the most beautifully crafted films I've seen in years, from the haunting cinematography to the songs and performances. In my opinion, this is by far the best film of the Grantland Rice Award-",1
27," ""There are no judgments. You don't have to change your mind. There are no choices. You just have to act. Through a complex web of lies, threats, and betrayals, I don't see any way out of the situation except either to confess, to confess, to confess, or to say I'm sorry and leave."" —David N. Lapid",1
28, I have seen this movie and even though I kind of knew who the killer was from the beginning I still liked watching it. I would recommend it to other people. It comes on Lifetime movie network quite a lot. And I am thinking since it's close to Halloween they might play it more. So please be on the look out for it if you are interested in watching it,1
29," And don't forget that this movie is also a sequel to Bloody Saturday. And if you haven't seen it yet, you should do it. It's a blast, as the title might suggest, and is definitely worth seeing. . .unless you dont like strong women or man and are too feisty to take control of the audience, which goes with being a woman",1
30," I heard it was on the air and then watched it last night at the TCM in Atlanta. I am in the business of finding out where movies are going to go so i never knew the movie was on the air in the first place. Anyway, this recent film is a story of two truly messed up characters, played by two really great actors. Sam Rockwell is",1
31," I'm going to go out on a limb and say that I'm not even a movie buff, let alone a connoisseur. But I do know what I like to see on the big screen, and this is one of those films that will appeal to me. I'm hoping that I'm doing something right. The plot, on the other hand, is a",1
32," 'Concho' is a little like 'Black Snake Moan,' but with too much alcohol in it. And one of the things that makes it so much better is that I hardly noticed it or, if I did, I was too drunk to see what was going on. What I did notice is the opening that I saw on the big screen (you know the one",1
33," Better known as the film that spawned the phrase 'The Great Escape,' the story of an escapee from the Spenser's prison is a tale that has remained in a darkly-at first darkly-content state ever since its release in 1956. The story of what happened to the escapee is ultimately a story of redemption for a guy, with a killer intent on",1
34," Before I try to analyze this, I must first get this out of the way before I start. I am a very subjective and emotional person. I actually dislike the film, and accept it. I think it's a wonderful film, and all of the reasons I don't like it. Also, I am not a big fan of movies which only include a bare minimum of",1
35, I have seen this movie and even though I kind of knew who the killer was from the beginning I still liked watching it. I would recommend it to other people. It comes on Lifetime movie network quite a lot. And I am thinking since it's close to Halloween they might play it more. So please be on the look out for it if you are interested in watching it,1
36," I saw this set in theaters, and I found it perfectly acceptable. Yes, it is basically a big fat soft-porn drama that was a bit of a drag to see. I did not find it a good comedy. One of the first feels to go, and the other to go, is your time management in what time is spending on this movie. I know",1
37," I first saw this film in the late 60's, and I have to say it was the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. You can see the blood in it, and I mean blood. There's some good stuff in there, but that's about it. It's pure sleaze. ",1
38, I have only seen the film once and I have to say that I enjoyed it very much. It is a beautiful film and I love the film enough to revisit it again. ,1
39, ,1
40," Legendary musician and composer Joseph Kosher, producer of 'Lovers of the Bell,' stars in this nostalgic and affecting true story of the first young Jewish couple. The film was filmed in 1962, so you see the family in their homes. The effects of the age of photography as we know it, using negative and negative only, are not present. All of the possible situations",1
41," I have been fortunate to see this show before, and it is fun to see the cast in its best shape. These days it's difficult to find a decent version of this movie, or even a film of its kind on a nationwide television network. I had only seen the film on TV (over the years) two times, and I haven't seen it on the big",1
42," I just saw this for the second time and like the first time. I liked the guts and the irony. The movie takes place in the big city and is not well shot, but the last few scenes are still very interesting. The movie is about Faith (Jennifer Connelly), a young woman who is kidnapped by a bunch of crazy guys and then put in a prison that",1
43, I liked this movie quite a bit. I liked the way that Jack Knight (Christopher Walken) was portrayed. I liked the way that the townspeople's fear of him was based on his hockey sense of the townspeople. I liked the way that the townspeople's fear of him was based on his ability to stay in the game whether it was as,1
44," The film is basically another version of The Magnificent Seven, with a new storyline. Unlike the original, this film has a larger cast of characters, but the overriding theme is similar. Sure, the six wheeling is a little more intense than the last seven, but it is equally capable of being mundane and compelling. This is a great movie to see if you like horror",1
45," In a time when we're so caught up in our own private dramas, we should all be grateful that this movie takes the time to remind us of the greatness of our community's ""self-defense"" efforts. This is a small silver-screen contribution to movie history. And I haven't seen it, so I can't say whether it was directed by Luis Bunuel",1
46," This is a beautiful, beautifully filmed, deeply haunting piece of cinema from a great director. I have seen it 3 times and have not tried to put it in order. It is not as good as 'Double Indemnity,' a far better film, but still a good movie, which is why it has gotten a cult following. I also found it to be very well",1
47," I haven't seen this movie, so I have no idea if it is any good. But I thought it was well-made and much better than I had expected. It is a revision of Shakespeare's play, and it is a short film. I have seen the original play three times, and this is pretty much a new version. Andrew Graham-Pallath has",1
48," Unfortunately, the first time I heard this was before seeing it on video and I was left with a sad, terrible ghost of my own childhood memories. It was the day before Halloween, and I am supposed to get a ticket for my friends, and it's a dismal drab movie I'm sure they all saw this year. I was bored with the story so I went",1
49," I've always been interested in this movie, but I didn't really know who the killer was until the finale of the last one. I almost did not finish it, but the last remaining scenes were so suspenseful and suspenseful, so you SHOULD finish the whole movie. The movie closes out with a final scene that reminds me of a final scene from 'Amusement",1
50," I keep seeing reviews for this movie, not because they are bad but because it's a startling film that has extremely negative aspects that the movie industry, and Hollywood in general, almost never considers. The film is evil, a snarling, mean-spirited, darkly humorous disaster of the first order, kind of like 'Zits' or 'Bloodsucker',",1
51," I saw it for the first time last night, and I guess I will be re-authoring the 'Thriller!' book. When I saw the title card for this film it said ""High Noon"" and I was surprised that this was the name of the movie that gave me the idea for Whos Who's Mel Gibson: The Last heist (best seller",1
52," I never gave high marks to shark fin soup films, particularly those in which some of the fin's teeth were missing, or which were made from macabre images of the human body. But it's a good thing I did. This is a dirty picture; the shark really looks like this. I would, however, make the reservation that this film does not capture the essence",1
53," This was a very strange movie for me to see, even though I usually do very odd things to make sure my friends and family know who I am. I find it difficult to watch this because like the other movies I've mentioned, it actually does remind me of a few sadistic shows that I saw in the late 60s. In this case, it is the clown",1
54," I saw 'High Noon' here today and I was blown away. I thought it was a great movie and really enjoyed it. I didn't know that the cowboy was a real person. The story was well told, the acting great, and the music was equally good. The only thing I don't like about the movie is the ending. It could have been brilliant,",1
55," The movie is not truly a movie, but a performance piece. There are no performances that are all that good. That said, I was very surprised by the significance of this film in the development of the Jewish theatre scene in the Midwest (along with other types of theatrical entertainment). Berdycki may be the most important, but his performance is rather one-dimensional - a",1
56," The only bad thing I can say about this movie is that I'm not a huge fan of this particular version of Shakespeare's play. The performances are not bad, but I can't stand the idea of the city people, especially the Jewish people, being driven to do the things the goons were doing in the movie, which was to take all the Jews out of the",1
57," I don't know why I couldn't wait this long to see this, but I did. I heard Tom Cruise's name mentioned and thought that he was the warm and fuzzy narrator. Instead, I was treated to a film that wasn't really about Tom Cruise, but at least was pretty good. The film did a few things that reminded me some of the issues that now",1
58," When I saw this in the theater, I merely had to wait two full minutes before the film had a chance to begin. It certainly had plenty of time. As for the actors, they were all very good. The supporting cast was nothing short of fantastic; I'm not sure if they all played together in the movie but all look very similar. In a few scenes I",1
59," Long before John Ford's ""Out of the Silent Planet,"" the same idea was expressed in the 1920's by the brothers Lawrence and Charles Chaplin. Now both movies have been remade in film. These are two of my favorite movies, and I love them both. I'd love to see a remake of these movies, but the studio prefers to cast actors who are better",1
60," A girl is kicked out. Shortly thereafter, she is the target of a serial killer. The killer is obsessed with his first victim, a young woman who she believes is his daughter. She is in the cab of a car that is traveling to a mortuary where she is going to be buried. His mind is shattered the moment she's hit by a car. With a",1
61," The film was quite good. As I said above, I was expecting this to be better than the first film. But like I said, I was expecting more of a neo-noir type of movie. This time it actually wasn't that bad. It's not great but it is okay. I will say that the script itself was rather good. I knew the story",1
62," One of my favorite movies in a long time. It's not a film I've seen every single time I've seen it, but if I'm feeling serious, I might do it every time. I love it when horror goes from being scary into being this level of entertainment. Such a great film. The acting is great. ",1
63," This movie is not the best one I have seen lately. It is not bad in any way, but it does have some flaws. It's about a young woman who is a car thief and a man who wants her to marry him. I don't think they were real people, and I don't know if they were even real people. But it was too early in",1
64," I saw this movie at the theater, and it was excellent. In spite of being a quick film, it is a very good concept. It is a comedy about a man who lost his wife and his son and the people who ruined his life. In a way, it is a picture of the late depression. There are a small number of people who become more malicious and",1
65," I enjoyed The Sound of My Heart more than I thought I would. I think that is because I liked director John Callea's last movie, and I liked seeing a more mature version of him. In this movie, his character is very simple, but he is also very realistic. The film itself is actually very well made and the soundtrack is excellent. ",1
66," Good story, good acting, good characters, good direction, very well done. Is ""Thoroughbred"" dating a movie that's turned my girlfriends on? ",1
67," A beautiful FX film. Directed by Fred Zinnemann and starring Jason Robards. As a former model and actress, his wife has been sick for about years now. She's in the middle of the hospital and can't come home to see her son who's waiting outside. This is a family movie. Jason is a very handsome young man with blond hair,",1
68," I've never seen this movie before because I've never heard of it. I kind of struggled to pick it up but now I'm watching it and am really enjoying it. But then I stopped thinking about it because I found out that it's based on William S. Burroughs book. I don't necessarily endorse everything in it, but I think it's worth an",1
69," This is a horror movie. It's not a comedy either, but it may just be the most fun horror movie I've ever seen. Jason Priestley does an excellent job. He seems to be the only person in the movie who is against the killer. He is a little old but that's okay. I can't believe how close together they are. And they all",1
70," I've been interested in this film for some time now, but it took me a while to realize that it was a fake. I figured I would give it a try anyway. This film is inspired by the George W. Bush...do you remember that?? ",1
71," I agree that the film is extremely poor and I know that I am probably not the only one who noted the same thing. I don't know what happened to this film in the movies and how much support during production there was. If you liked It, I Hope you liked it too. ",1
72," When I saw this movie I was mostly worried. I was worried I would like the movie less than I did. But I did not. It was a nice, sad, and serious film. There are no better words to describe this story. If you are a person who loves the ocean, like I love the ocean, or like I like the ocean, then this movie",1
73, This is the first time since Looney Tunes II when I have seen a film that I have been really interested in. It's a film that wants to entertain and satisfy but it comes at you as a very ugly and dirty movie. I think they need to do a better job with the dialogues and the action. This movie just seems odd and didn't make me,1
74," I watched this movie last night and I think it had an interesting plot, just in a different way than the original. I think they could have done a better job of creating the reader's mind with the idea of a young, poor girl who spends her life in a loveless house. But the cleverness of this film was missing. And that was a nice",1
75, I'm really sad that this movie has been wiped off the American Network. I've been waiting for this film since I first heard about it. I thought that the movie did not do as well as I had hoped. But after seeing the trailer I was extremely wrong. I was taken into a really dark and scary place. I loved everything about this movie. I thought it,1
76," A lot of movies come along and you like them. But when you plan to watch them a lot, is it wise? I would say no. A lot of movies just don't really appeal to me. I like a good story and a good message. And I don't feel that I get to see what other people think about a movie. This movie worked for me",1
77," What a good film! A great concept album of the Beatles' ""Yellow Submarine."" Sure, I am not a Beatles fan, but I think they are cool. I think that these songs are pretty good. The theme song is really good. ",1
78," I am a big fan of the Eric Roberts character in the movie ""The Blair Witch Project."" I have seen the movie three times. I didn't really like it initially but I have been a fan of the movie for a while now. They get in some nice action shots. It's a pretty good movie. It was not very good for me. It was kind of",1
79," I think it's a beautiful movie. It plays like a narrative play, but with a more serious edge to it. This is the first time that I saw one of the picture's for the first time. It was hilarious,reat,which was the movie. I love watching a movie like this. Also, I think it's the best movie I've seen in the",1
80," Some movies are just a chore to watch. - What's it going to be like, what's gonna happen, what's gonna happen? Killing a guy off? - Who'da thunk it, huh? The same goes for the great Alfred Hitchcock's films. What Hollywood needs is an idea to carry the ball, and get it off the ground. The sound levels",1
81," This is a new kind of production featuring the first Turkish cast. I am not sure that this is a very good first film for Turkish actors. But it is worth seeing. Besides, for the original cast, the new cast is better than the old. The new cast is older, even more talented, and has a great sense of humor as well as a little Syrian soul",1
82," I am a huge fan of TIFF, but I used to dislike the Toronto International Film Festival. This year I saw a movie named ""The Master of Ballantyne"" near the front of the festival. It had a nice story, and was a nice little movie. As it was starting out (and extremely cliché) I knew that this was going to be okay,",1
83," Speaking of Shakespeare, this is not the first time we've seen a movie about him. It's been done (for the most part) before in several countries. But here it's the first time that scriptwriters have attempted to have a play of Shakespeare in the form of a movie. The story is well-written enough to get through to the audience. It's a",1
84," I found the film somewhat disappointing. It seems like a big production from the first 10 minutes. It is not self explanatory that this film is a parody of the great emphasis on the importance of being attractive. A few scenes seem to have been heavily filmed. The use of computer-generated images is distracting, and may be seen as a ruse to put off viewers, since",1
85," A strange New York neighborhood of the 1930's is shown through the eyes of the lead character. I actually thought that this was a terrible idea. Although this is the first interpretation of the play that I actually liked, I think it would have been better, allowing the director to show us what he wanted to show. But, for the first time, we see the view from",1
86," An interesting interpretation and presentation of the past. The story is split into three sections: the tragic story of King Lear, a tale that we often associate with Shakespeare; comedic and tragic tales of King Richard II; and the great-grandfathers ofHenry IV, also known as King Richard I.",1
87," I'm not surprised that the first movie in this popular series of films (following ALIENS) was a sleeper hit. It bears similarities in tone and style to the popular cult classic THE LAST MAN ON EARTH. But it is also a bit different in its premise - the story of a group of stranded astronauts in a post-apocalyptic space, who must find",1
88," This is a good, little movie. The acting is actually good, and I liked the script. It's not that it's difficult to see how the movie succeeds, but it has a very conventional structure, and I think that the actors play the characters, rather than the events, well enough. It's no wonder that it got a positive review from the Daily Mail.",1

90," Not only may the content be realistic, but the acting is also. Actually, this makes it a bit better than most of the other movies I've seen recently. It's funny, but it's also realistic in the way the characters are made out to be if they are the victims of the world's cynical, corrupt, and uncharismatic rulers. I don't",1
91," We're not talking violent, bloody crime here. This sweet, funny film about a young man's decision to leave the pining, dejected state of his marriage after his wife's death and follow the career of an opera singer, takes us a little deeper into the human psyche than most, or at least a few, of the films we have recently seen. Perhaps a",1
92," This was the first of the two sequels to the popular 1970s-era film, ""The Special Unit,"" and it was the first movie that starred Al Pacino. It is set in the year 2044, and the story follows a team of heroic agents (in this case, the trained operatives) on a mission which must take them into the S.U.T",1
93," It is a pity that the movie ""The Great Escape"" was not made before this one. Not because of the fantastic gore (which is the case with all of them), but because it would've benefited the movie in the eternal search for the true story. And you would have gotten it. It's just so terrible. The story is ludicrous. It's a metaphor for",1
94," I was excited to see the film adaptation of the Danish film ""September to June."" While I've seen a lot of Swedish films, I've never seen anything like this. The film is beautifully filmed in beautiful landscapes, with excellent camera work, dialogue, and a well-developed mood. The story is simple, but the actors are superbly cast. The only problem I",1
95," I was drawn to the name ""İscalı"" (from Turkey) by the lovely language in the title. Actually, this film is a joint effort with the Turkish film industry as a whole, with both directors and actors playing Turkish roles. And the film is the first-run release of a new production - in this case, a Turkish-language version.",1
96," Everything in this movie is so good it's almost impossible to dislike it. It's only a matter of time until someone will get a hold of it and start to see the possibilities of a movie like this. The actors in it are so good, and their chemistry with real actors is so real, it's quite impressive. The script is good, the story is well done",1
97," I think that the best American work of Art should be those of Americans, rather than European. The main reason for the movie's success is its cultural timing, with its easy-to-understand dialogue, fast-paced action, and good external shots. Much of the cast is unfamiliar to me, but the actors don't let me down either, with the exception of",1
98," I am surprised that no one has ever come up with the idea of making a modern-day version of Shakespeare's masterpiece. Superficially, it seems as though the movie is in the shape of the old-fashioned classic film The Merchant of Venice, with a twist. The film takes place during a time of dramatic social upheaval, with life and reputation in shamb",1
99," Trying to see a new movie not too bad, but it makes you feel terrible. It's not very good. The movie stars Reese Witherspoon as a green-eyed, blond-haired, blue-eyed, isis-wearing, Australian woman, and two ridiculous Vietnamese boy-band singers. People (and women) are definitely living in a different era",1
100," I was sure I wouldn't like this movie, the reviews say that it is a "" Poor man's "" "" a "" romantic comedy "" "" "" "" and I was totally wrong, the movie is not that.

101," Its a shame she didn't get screen credit , she by far did the best job in the film has the girl on the cross , best part of the movie .She had much more impact than Avril , or just about anyone else in the film . She almost made S/M look like fun ! She really was believable has the S/M model that gets scared of",1
102," The most intense scenes took place in the theme park, where they lived, both in a feverish excitement and bitter cold, and his eyes glowed at the reflection of a red-hot window. The almost sexual scenes with both of these girls are so unique, to witness someone you usually not really know or familiar with this very often makes you feel ashamed and sad. I",1
103, I loved the language! The actual Spanish I fell in love with. I could feel the passion and excitement. And the great performance by Barbra Streisand. The lead actress is taking great care to show her emotions. ,1
104," Like all my friends who watch this movie, I saw the first preview of it, and I felt very disappointed by the imagery. As I began to see the movie, and realised that it was not as violent as it seemed, I was very pleasantly surprised. I immediately got into this movie and was very impressed by the actors. All the actors are so well cast in this",1
105," It is the best movie on acting I have ever seen. All the artists are old Turkish theater actors, they are magnificent in this movie. It is sometimes said that ""They do not act, they live it"", you can really see this in this movie. The director is also competent, you cannot see lots of moving cameras around but the positions of the cameras are also good",1
106," This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. We need to change our political thinking to be more realistic about our society. This is a movie about the relationships between people, including organized religion, relationships with people, even relationships with each other, our planet, and the way that we use it all. It is a movie about love, relationships, understanding, trust",1
107," The film has its problem, it was too soon, and it's boring. The story is too easy to follow and not enough depth to be interesting. The women are young, and exaggerate their sexuality, which is normal in 20's and 30's. It's weird, especially since the movie has its controversy about how much porn is portrayed in the film, and it",1
108," What a cheap shot! To tell you the truth, I thought that a lot of the film was too dirty. I was surprised to see that the movie was shot in a lot of different scenes ,and that the director has made this movie in the style of a porn film. I also thought the film was not very good, not because of the movie itself but because of",1
109," This is a great movie! What she did was so beautiful, and what she was doing was so mysterious and wonderful! It really is very creative and fascinating! It seems that the director has really escaped from the old movie industry and is now doing the new way! It is really a joy to watch a movie like this.<br /><br />My only complaint is that",1
110," This movie is a very enjoyable movie. It's funny, realistic and very entertaining. The movie is made by a nice young director, pay attention to his style of directing. This is how one can see a whole movie being made by one person. The movie is in my opinion the best movie on acting I have ever seen in recent years. This is where one gets a",1
111," I found this to be a good movie to watch, to see the antics of the sea; its funny and cute, the girl is not likeable and even the captain is just a character they just have to like to watch. They seem to be quite unlike the usual cast of film, and the movie has a vintage feel to it. I liked the scenes of the ship",1
112, This is a very pleasant surprise when I found out how fairy tale comes to life. It's full of heartwarming and powerful stories that seem to be true and help you to feel happy. I was really amazed when I realized how a simple story about a girl who knew a certain doctor and wanted to marry him sounds like a mature fairy tale. It is a story about searching,1
113," I considered the reason why I watched this film, and I was not disappointed. I thought that the energy in Avril's face was completely portrayed and her attitude was fitted. This was a film that was not to be missed. I thought that I liked Avril because she was curvy, and her breasts were not so high. That makes a beautiful woman, I think",1
114," I was going to write a two part review, but the movie left me with the impression that it is just a soap opera type of movie. You can see the young muse of the god-like painter with a little too many words, but he is also a bisexual, she has plenty of free time, she is a beautiful woman, and she is a drunkard.<",1
115," When I first saw the movie, I thought it was a very boring film.The plot was not interesting, there was no mystery of the undercover agent in a boat in the middle of the sea, just a bunch of people in low-cut dresses dancing and singing that sounds really nice in the sea. It's probably the best sad movie I ever saw ",1
116," A movie is an encyclopedia of things that happened in Hollywood, a novel is a collection of elements that can make a movie work. I hope the people who are watching this movie will like it. I had a part in the movie (like in the movie). It was fun to watch the girls dancing with the guys, we all know how it is to be with a girl",1
117," You are watching a man with a Russian accent, being the kind of guy who would rather be played by a Japanese actress. It's hard to keep your mouth shut when you don't have a sense for female emotions. I thought the movie was amazing, it seemed so realistic. It's not the most traditionally beautiful film in relation to its era, but I thought it was",1
118," I have a love for Shakespeare but it took me a while to end up this way.<br /><br />This was one of those movies that made me laugh so much, I was crying with laughter too. It was a cute film, with a surprising number of plot twists, and a very charming story. A very entertaining that i would recommend it to anyone. And",1
119, I enjoyed the movie. I thought it was a nice looking movie. I also liked the acting. I liked how it annoyed people and made me want to laugh. I loved the adventure of the sailor ; he was really entertaining. Another lame subplot was the fact that a sailor could only have a girl in the family. It was nice to see the sailor cutting off his,1
120," One of my favorites. The director is a wonderful guy. It is such an emotional movie, and the actors are wonderful. It is not realistic, but it is a story that I would never have thought of and I enjoyed it very much. I am glad the film got a NC-17. ",1

122," I was a little disappointed in this movie. It was very good, but I was expecting something a little darker and grimmer. I really enjoyed the film but I think I am a little disappointed in the movie overall. There were a few scenes that I liked, but not all of them. I think it was necessary for the movie to get rid of the dead character,",1

124," I haven't read the book , but I've seen the movie. It is an excellent film in its own right, but the best part is the quality of the acting by everybody - from the young actors to the old ones. The film is fast paced and exciting. The performances by the cast are superb, even better than the movie.<br /><br />I rate",1
125," Example of a film of this kind: "" The Wizard of Oz "". <br /><br />This movie is not much of a movie. The acting is really not bad. The story is the same as the others, although the events in the story are different. But the acting is pretty good. As for the movie's content, it has the same film as the",1
126," ...this movie is the best one I have seen in a long time. It's amazing how great the acting is in this movie. And there are a lot of great female roles. But I love the one in the film called ""The Woman In Black"" too. It's so sad. I know there are a lot of people who thought the movie was one of the",1
127," Yes. You can choose whether you are glad or not, many people just are, and some people are not so glad. If it is sad, you probably agree about this. If you think it is bad, you probably agree too. I really think it is bad. RIP, John. You have some kind of disease that would take me to hell in a hand basket",1
128, My brother and I both loved this film. It was dark and lonely and a worthy watch. It was scary too. I think you should gosee this again.<br /><br />I think the movie is going to be a staple of the summer for a long time to come. ,1
129, Just a pleasure to watch this movie. The actors are superb. It is also a pity that this is a comedy. ,1
130," This is a movie that I had wanted to see since I was a little girl. I wanted to go to a theater and see a concert-concert by Waylon Jennings. Now I know the truth of the matter. I saw ""Let me tell you about a girl."" I was NOT expecting the film to be bad. The plot line, director, and the performances were",1
131," It shows the love of the human potential, the desire to live. It's what makes men and women happy. Its what makes people happy when they live. Its what makes anybody happy. Every person should see this movie. It must be on your list of the most famous films to see. ",1
132," This movie is incredible and you will love it. It is a must see. It is the best movie on acting that has ever been made. I will not lie , I was scared when I heard about the remake but once I saw it, I was tingling all over my body. It is the best movie I have ever seen in my life. ",1

137," It is a comedy, but it is more like a comedy than a comedy. Its a real amusing movie, in a funny way. Cate is a nightmare. She is the most annoying character in the movie. On the other hand, this movie is so funny that you can't help laughing. She is so good at being annoying. She really has a dark side,",1

139," Love the movie about S/M. It's very well done. It has a lot of different scenes that you don't get in most movies where they hide behind the camera. I really like the director's planning in this movie. Most of the scenes are not that long, and they don't do them as often would like, but they do them well. Most of",1

143," They knew how to have real adult characters with a different personality and an adult dream to go along with it. I think the addition of young daughter Kerry made this film for me , because I think Kerry is just so refreshing , very well balanced and likable as well. I think she has the witty voice and a self-confidence and intelligence that is really refreshing to have in",1
144, I haven't had a chance to listen to this one yet but i'm hoping that it will be good. Well its a very good show. S/M is in the news now and one of the people on this show talks about S/M in the news. But the show is classified for M/M and the musician in it is probably a m/f.,1

151, I thought the movie was alright to hear the story of an alcoholic family that is trying to make it in the big city. It had the look of a movie I thought would be a bit too 'meow meow' to watch. I also thought Ritter was underplayed as the sadist that is killing the family. If I had to choose a negative point about,1
152," This is a great R, so true to what it says on the box, if you haven't seen it in theaters yet you've been mislead. This is a great film. Pretty good for a movie that has got so many scenes in it that need to be seen in theaters. The story is about two brothers who were at a funeral and the father sees a woman in",1
153," Now comes the bad news, because its not like I'm afraid of DARKEST HISTORY and its not like I'm afraid of the movies in general. The movie is very infantilizing to some extent, but I'm glad a few things came out of the woodwork, and I'm glad that its a film about respect for life. And I have to say that",1

I went into it very apprehensive because it was the first Riddick film I had seen and I was not happy with the trailer. I had seen the",1

Even the main character is very funny, but that's about it. Meryl Streep's voice is just as strong as the actors' on the screen. There is SO MUCH that can be done",1

162," This was the first film that I saw of director John Crowley's new film, and I had to say this show had the best I have seen of him in many years. It is well made, clever, emotionally devastating, and sets a great tone for this genre. The director did a great job directing the first few scenes in this film, and then gave more creepiness",1
163," When it comes to Robert Altman re-teaming with his son, the animated specials, you'd think it would be the Rocky series, but in this case it's the The Wild Bunch. This show is all about the family. From the moment we meet the mother holding their infant baby, we learn it is a miracle he's alive. ",1

It was the first show of the evening and one of the funniest bits of the evening was when one of the gangre saw a naked guy in a guys underwear. This pushed him over the edge of his emotional operating system and he",1
168," Here is a good film. Its a must see. The acting is very good and the story is well thought out with action and suspense. But the best part of the movie are the characters. I was very happy to see the success of Ronnie Corbett's in his film ""The King's Speech"" ",1

The story dealt with the working class issues of helping those in need, however in this case, it also dealt with the class issues of a couple whose relationship you can see at times is",1
171, This was really good. It's a good comedy that does a good job of poking fun at the movie industry. I thought it was a fun and entertaining show. I think its great that you can have a laugh at how much money they spend on actors when they don't even bother casting them. You have to be able to buy into the commercial nature of the show to,1
172," A beautiful, calming, just-you-mean-it take on the world.

The simple call to action,",1
173, This film is about the people who were living in the second half of the 20th century. The film starts with an interview of a young guy who comments and reminisces about things that he didn't even remember in the era of television. It is also about the people of the state of Oklahoma which is a far cry from the '90's. It is also not about,1
174," One of the most underrated things about this film is the chemistry among the actors. There is not a single scene that is not shot well, and I'm generally not a big fan of the original. I would love to see a remake of this, but of course, that would be a big investment. In this film, they are just great people who just want to make",1

178," I'll say it up front, I'm a fan of Mandy Patinkin and I don't mind seeing his character get some angst. If you think Mandy Patinkin is the epitome of acting that he's acted before, you're wrong. This is a really great return to form. ",1
179," This weirdo goofy drama is a great odd mix of comedy and drama, which in turn is sort of a strange mix of restorative and painful. The comedy consists of a story about a young couple's attempted suicide, an attempt that turns into an ugly, pointless experiment. The drama involves a lovely young couple who want to be a family again. ",1
180," A haunting, immersive mystery! Peter Farrelly and Lee Evans star in this exceptional, intelligent, yet unproduced, Portland, Oregon-set mystery/horror film.

182," A comedy of ideas, told in such a breezy way that it doesn't seem like there's any remoteness from the outrageousness of the characters. Even the characters are given a voice. One of the best films in the varsity sport of TV. Even with all the ""techniques"" used it still felt like a movie. I would recomend it",1
183," When I first heard the news that a tech company owned by the men who killed my mum have bought the rights to make a film about the death of my mum, I was genuinely shocked because it seemed so out of touch.

189," This is a movie that will have you dancing with the motion picture bug. The story is simple: A sheriff confronts a woman about the murder of his wife and brother. The movie is good and it makes you want to dance, but it is not a typical western. This film is about a sheriff, two men, a woman and a horse.<br /><br />",1
190," That is what I've heard about this film. As the film begins it's clear that it's about a crime and it's about the perpetrators. Funny, and thought provoking. The mood is set perfectly for a film like this. Although the film was shot on a budget, it was shot for a higher budget. The cinematography, sets and costumes are outstanding. The",1
191," Well, I guess I would like to say that I am sorry that I did not like this film it was so good. Bertrand Tavernier is one of the best actors of our time and he made a movie that was really good. I would like to see a movie with more of his characters but i dont think this is done right. The film was probably one of",1
192, It seems a shame that the great Benny Hill made such a small contribution to this film. He seems to have been a bit on the other side of the tracks. Perhaps this is karma for the terrible standards he set. The film itself does manage to be funny - most of the time. It might not be as good as the short films found in the book but its certainly,1
193," The first time I saw this movie it left a bad taste in my mouth. What happened to ""the best chance there was"" to come out of a film house?

He has a huge accomplice called Dick who is always trying to get him to do something for him! I also liked this film because of the appearance of John Hurt and might have been a bit disappointed if he had been,1
199, I think this is a new and unique type of film. It is a film about a guy who starts to go insane after meeting a woman. Robert Carson plays a mental patient who is being cared for by a man and a mentally ill man named Lonnie. They both try to kill each other but that turns out to be difficult. I liked this film because it had a,1
200," If you're a fan of The Godfather trilogy or the (then) cult classic Casablanca, you'll be able to appreciate the dramatically and narratively novelizing narrative of The Ascension.

The Art of War was directed by the charismatic Leo DiCaprio, and was the first of his films not to star Leonardo DiCaprio",1

But the movie excelled as",1

Cabaret! was the last in the series, and was a big hit. The plot was",1
252," Nowhere has a filmmaker been as slick as Andrei Tarkovsky in this masterpiece, a film which is much more than a slick teaser, and a rather good one.

The Soviet Union was relocated from area to area within the US-occupied USSR during the second World War, and",1
256," This was a great follow-up to 'The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner.' It was enjoyable, though not as inspirational as the first.

These are the flawed people that, despite their hardships",1
257," I have always associated Hamlet with Shakespeare. His famous soliloquy concerns the choices of his characters at the end of the play in Hamlet's castle where he is grievously wounded.

270, This is the rare movie that has been able to recapture the magic that was once the hallmark of The Phantom of the Opera.

It is a true triumph. It is fun because,1

The aliens then kidnap and brainwash the man into the X-Men and begin an attempt to build a rocket which would be able to go",0
43," ""Rocketship X-M"" is based on the real-life story of the invention of an interplanetary rocket ship by the visionary and imaginative truck driver, Dixon Henderson. Henderson had simply invented the rocket ship with a simple design - a rocket engine attached to the top of the rocket ship where the rocket would propel it up to the surface of the moon. He",0
44," ""Rocketship X-M"", a short documentary about a group of international nuclear scientists seeking new energy sources, was first conceived as a documentary produced for NASA's ""Popular Science"". It aired for national television on NASA's public affairs broadcast channel, ""NASA Sunday"". It is a disappointment, even for a short film, in terms of the quality of the story and",0
45," ""Destination Moon"" is a prequel to ""Star Trek"", an off-beat sci-fi flick which seems to pay homage to ""Star Wars"". The movie was released in the US, Australia, and Canada to a relatively low box-office. Many people thought that it was just like all the other sci flicks that are marketed as ""mission fun"", or",0
46," This movie actually isn't like the other mock-ups we've seen. It is much better and much better than the others, and many of you will disagree with me. This movie is far more interesting than the others because it DEFINITELY shows what can be done with the Michael Bay standard of taking a giant spaceship (in this case, a shuttle) and creating",0

Bob Robertson (Michael Rooker) is a NASA astronaut who knows that most of the space station's essential systems are out of commission. Consequently, he's",0
48," This is the kind of movie that you cannot wait to let the kids watch alone because they will probably love it. But the kids will probably hate it, but you can't win against those people. The movie will probably be ruined by its inability to clearly define the roles of the characters. It's very well-executed, but this is a studio movie, so the",0
49," I guess this would be a movie for diehard sci-fi fans. If you play back the movies of old, then you will find that ""Rocketship X-M"" is really, really, really bad. The only thing I don't really get from this movie is the audacity to call it an ""exploration"" of the interstellar realm, much like",0
50," It's hard to tell how many times this movie has been seen since it debuted on TV. Back in the early 60s, this movie was a hit. To put it into context, in the 1940s, ""Star Trek"" was a major hit. All of this makes it even more fitting that ""Rocketships X-M"" is my favorite film of all",0
51," This is a very dark film in the vein of ""The Gate"" and ""The Thing"". The story starts out a little differently than ""Rocketship X-M"". The men's group is trying to get to ""Destination Moon"" without the help of the aliens and they have a problem. The men refuse to use the spaceship at all, and get their change",0

This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. One of the most common reasons people might not think of the Hiroshima bombing is that it's not popular.",0
53," The basic plot is about a man who arrives at an alien space station with ""destined"" passengers. From there he encounters the crew of a spacecraft near the station, and then the ship itself falls prey to the station's mysterious abilities. In classic MST3K fashion, the story is built around the distorted rants of the crew, who may or may not be",0
54," So, I figured the movie would be more or less a riff on ""Rocketship X-M"", but I gotta tell you, this movie is EVERYTHING else about this crap. Because the story is uninteresting yet the plot is basically a one-sheet to the core. The plot is that they steal a spaceship and crash into the earth and the main character dies",0
55," The generic horror flick has a happy disaster that's ripped from the headlines, then proceeds to throw in a few random scenes; the result is a frangipani-like flight path through some space rocks, and an over-the-hill actor who's trying to get his girlfriend to return home to his family. I'm glad the movie got cut from the theatrical release",0
56," When me and my GF went to see this film, we didn't know what to expect, however she assured me that it had good reviews. So I went along with it. We got into the cinema and bought tickets and went into the screen. After a while of sitting there waiting for the film to start no one else walked through the door. I was very suspicious as",0
57," The storyline is fine, but the execution is horrible. The movie draws you in right from the beginning with a new alien spacecraft, which has been activated by the aliens. While the aliens have been friendly to humankind, a race of space agitators has taken of all the natives and has de-evolved them into a new breed of telepaths. The aliens are",0

As fate would have it, she's unaware that the man she is being taken with isn't her true guardian, but a man she's found in the form of a gray alien,",0
59," This film is an entertaining comedy about a man who is going to space to prove he can do things that are impossible. I'm sure this movie will probably have some tiring jokes and some references and references to pop culture, but it's decent as something to watch to have a laugh. Michael J Fox has a nice supporting role of which the emotional development of the main character",0
60," Very entertaining at times, but at times reaches a point where the film becomes too personal. Riveting at times, a little too personal at times, but a tad too personal to tell the story we want to. A story revolving around a man whose wife has recently died, and a stranger who seems to have a sense of humor, and the little girl who doesn't",0
61," When I first heard how this film was coming out, I was glad that it was coming out the first summer in an attempt to increase the box office, I was like what they say kids, don't forget about the box office, that's what keeps you going. So, I was excited to see this film when it was released, I saw it in the theater and",0
62, This movie disappointed me. The premise is a serial killer in the back-ground. This could easily be the most exciting and exciting horror film of the year. But this film is so completely horrible that it's hard to be excited for it. The film focuses on a serial killer named Bob. He is a serial killer. He is a killer. He is trying to stop,0

I didn't particularly want to quit my job at a big firm, but I was certainly going to do what I felt I had to do. When I got off the phone,",0
64," When I saw this film, I was immediately put in to a mental state of loss. While the movie is technically one of the greatest propaganda films of all time, it is a bit unfocused and not very well presented. As a result, I felt so lost as to just not have the ability to enjoy it. I also found the young woman (Linda Carter) to",0
65, I was watching this film in the theater with my girlfriend. It's one of those movies that feels fresh and new whenever you see it. I was hoping that this movie would be a good movie. It's never a bad movie when it's good. I completely underestimated it. I didn't expect much at all but it was... good. I'm not gonna go into,0
66," This is one of those films that had me staying up all night long, and I'm not even sure if they fixed the film riding on the train to get to work. This is an honest, accurate story about how a man murdered his family and how the police caught him and how he was tried for it. The film starts with the family having to flee the town of",0
67," When I saw this, my first thought when I saw Bob and Marion was that it was about them being spoiled rich kids. Well, after a few hours of trying to get it to work I realised that it was about the rich kids who were stupid enough to take advantage of a high school student. Then I saw the way the rich kids wasted the girl's childhood and how",0
68," This is a movie that I've been looking forward to seeing, but until now I've only seen it in the theater. This is a film that is visually stunning, but the performance of director James L. Brooks is somewhat unimpressive. Brooks is a master of surrealistic filmmaking and he's managed to pull off a few so-so films which was a bit disappointing",0
69," I grew up watching this movie and I remember how the writing was so bad and the direction was so bad, especially in the opening scene. I run down the streets of Upper West Side thinking that I am a psychopath and this movie is a movie out of pity. ",0
70," I came into the cinema today and I played the tickets that the front desk gave me as I was standing outside the cinema waiting to buy tickets. I was trying to pick up a friend from the bar and I noticed a couple sitting outside the cinema. I looked around and I saw them, and I remember thinking to myself, why don't they go to the cinema? I",0
71," One of the more entertaining movies I saw this year was this one calling itself a thriller. A family is caught out of their home and has, the entire family, thrown it all into a big house. All of these people are being watched and keeps track of who is watching who. This is a great movie that will keep you guessing from start to finish with a stellar plot",0
72," While I knew it would be an action flicks, the best part of the film was watching the crew take out the lead while the lead was disappeared so the team could capture the lead. But after the team finally get the lead, the movie just runs out of steam. Why bother with the suspense when the lead is gone? Yeah the movie is realistic, but the director",0
73," This is a story-within-a-story-story-story-story. It's set in the early 1940s, when the United States is fighting the Nazis in Europe. One of the things that the movie and the writer-director do, is that they go into that at least partially in the third person narrative viewpoint, and distort the story in both the literal",0
74," Haha this film is really cheesy. So I went to see it, and I really enjoyed it. I can't tell you how much I enjoyed it. It was very well directed. I liked the dialog that was used. It was very well written. I liked the way the characters interacted with each other and with the scenery. I enjoyed the plot. I liked how",0
75," This film did a great job of staying away from the norm and staying true to the source of the story lived out by the up and coming film star of today, Keye L. Ballard. ""The Lost Girls"" recounts the story of two young women a prostitute named Elizabeth and a young beauty in the opposite sex called Marion. The story unfolds as Marion moves from one """,0
76," Relatively for one, there is little or nothing wrong with this film. There are some really good performances and a very great script, but overall the film, while looking like it had an interesting story and some interesting characters, doesn't really have the depth it should have. The film tries to jump from situation to situation, but has no real direction to it at all.",0
77," A man gets separated from his family and he is hiding out in an abandoned house. The story focuses on a strange, sinister family of a family of an insane man with the ability to walk on water. The family is also a cult and they are the only ones who know what is going on and where the person is. The man hides both in and out of the house",0
78," I was really looking forwards to seeing this film when I saw it last year, but in the end I was left with a horrible feeling that I was never going to see it. The reason is that I have yet to watch it on the big screen. The character of Danny is nice, and the slapstick scenes with a boy called Brian are funny. However.. the story",0
79," Now this is a film that could have been great, but that's because the wonderful horror writer David Lynch gave it to us in his mind. Except for a few scenes the film was horrible, and the rest was just to elaborate on Lynch's work. It is also a nice-to-see movie but one that I would have expected from Lynch in the past. Given",0
80," This film has a nice look and feel to it, but it just make me tired of the same old thing. Still I still enjoyed just watching it no matter what it was about. It had good action scenes and decent performances. The only problem was that usually the director or writer have a good idea of what they want the audience to do and this time they didn't.",0
81, Films within films I was watching the first time I saw this film. I'm trying to remember if it's a surprise film or not because it's so sad. I can't forget hating the look of the film. I certainly I'll admit that it was entertaining enough to get through it. I'm not a fan of this type of film at all. ,0
82, I didn't expect to like this movie but I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe it was because of my friend's boyfriend Jerry who has been a huge horror fan since childhood. The similarities to the original are pretty obvious and the characters are also very much like the original. The director Miller and writer Roamy The movie is shot in real time as if we are watching the movie and,0
83," It had to be the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Very unstylish, very colourful, very over the top with very little direction, very unusual costumes, very cheap shots and very bad actors. 1 star for that alone. ",0
84,A murder mystery of sorts where you are finding out the truth about a long time dead person. Obviously the motive is to avenge his family ex-girlfriends death. You can see the way they work from it. It's a pretty good movie. ,0
85," After my dna test was completed, I had the chance to complete this movie. I had been really interested in the film since I heard that the director was Sam Mendes. I have never seen a more beautiful movie. The studio made a mistake by not to casting Gael García Bernal which I think detracts from the film. The film was very beautiful and I",0
86," I've never been a huge fan of horror films. Usually I just don't like them. This time we watched it together. I thought the talking was great and I thought the character of Bob was a nice character. Just when you think you've made it through a whole movie, there is another one coming out with the same exact theme. ",0
87," We are normally not much for horror films so I was expecting something really terrifying, which I thought it would be. I was pleasantly surprised when we watched this movie. I thought it was a bit weird and I'm not sure why I was expecting anything that wasn't. What I did like is that it had good reviews. ",0
88," I saw this film at my local theatre which is usually a good place to see some sort of spy thriller. This was my first time seeing the film and I thought it looked great. I thought the first half of the film was ok, the second half was bad. I think I knew what was going to happen in the second half of the film as well. I thought",0
89," If you are looking for a disturbing or chilling movie to watch, then this is it. It has some very disturbing scenes and it pulls no punches. It is horror but that's expected, even with such a positive, positive cast. ",0
90," I'm not really sure why I saw this movie, but I do know that I won't be returning to this cinema again. It was completely and utterly awful. The first half of the film was decent, but the second half it actually turned out to be really bad. I have to say that Ryan Gosling was magnificent, but I'm not really sure he's a",0
91, I really liked that film and if you are a fan of this film you would have to have this on DVD. If you are not a fan too see it. It is worth watching ,0
92," I'm not giving a bad review, but this is just a ridiculous film that you should only see if you like a certain genre of films, i. ",0
93," I'm not a fan of vampire but I did enjoy this film because of the style of the style. I didn't mind the fact that a vampire was entwine with a vampire in this film, so I didn't mind seeing the fight scenes in blood. I liked the way that the movie started with Johnny after he and Marion had a day together. I liked the way",0
94, I think this movie was an ingenious mix of neuroscience science and music. You can feel the science in it. It was very interesting although at the end I felt that they did not go far enough. I saw this film close to my parents wedding and we were at the church to wish her well and I know her reaction was sad. ,0
95," This film is perfectly wonderful and somehow I had to add a few comments. I liked this movie right away because it deals with something that many of us,but if you like a good, complex story, you should see this film. ",0
96," I really was expecting to love this film. I have heard amazing things about it and that was from people who don't have a clue about horror films, so I thought it would be a great film to watch. I wasn't what you'd expect from this genre but that was expected. It was a great fun film. So far this isn't going to be my favourite",0

98," First off I have to say that I am a big fan of horror films. I think they have got it right, so I am sad that I am not a big fan of this movie.I enjoyed it a lot. That being said the film, although very disturbing, was not horrible.I don't like to get too into the film, but I liked what it",0
99, I went and saw this with my girlfriend on a date. We had a good dinner and by the time we were going to go to bed I was starting to become quite excited. I was not disappointed when we got to the film. I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed this film. It was well made and the acting was very good. ,0
100," It is a total disaster. I was thrown out of it at the very beginning. What was supposed to be a slow building up was defaced into what I would now describe as a really bad blend of comedy, horror and shock. ",0
101," This movie was so bad, that it didn't even entertain me. I watched it when it was on at least 3 different times in a row, and couldn't even stand to see the credits. This movie made me sick, and couldn't believe that someone would make another one of their scams in this manner. These types of movies are what makes me sick. They make",0
102," Trouble in paradise. A movie that had a great idea, but totally got away from it. I don't know if it's a good movie or a bad movie, but it wasn't worth the $3.50 which I paid. It's just a waste of money. ",0
103, Here are a special few pictures of this DVD to suggest that it's worth the extra few bucks for the $7.99 you can get for the extra pictures. ,0
104," Worth a watch for turns out this movie had some great ideas and was a lot of fun. Maybe not for all people. But for those who appreciate the kind of fun that made it, this was enjoyable. ",0
105," I loved this movie. The movie is about a world where people are immune to technology, and where people can be turned into vampires. I think that this casting of Lynne Ramsay gives this movie a great deal of suspense. ",0
106, I was just drawn to this movie. What a great movie with a great cast who portrayed a great crime thriller. I really enjoyed the movie. Just wish there was some actual suspense to the film instead of all the screaming and swearing that was done in the film. ,0
107, I have to tell you this is a fantastic movie. I laughed the entire time and I was shocked by all the twists and turns. The performances by both Bob and Marion were wonderful. I laughed a lot and shed a few tears. I thought the ending was so funny. ,0
108," I hate to see the world, but don't take anyone who has a big family, or who is a family member or a friend seriously if they have a lot of money and can afford to go to college and buy the world's most expensive ticket. ",0
109," I heard about this movie on the TV show LAKE SHORE about Bob and Marion. It was funny, but also sad. Bob and Marion lived life to the fullest until one fateful day. They made the best of their life, but it was not enough. Jeff Bridges, the star of the movie, was the star of the show. I think he played the role",0
110," The movie was OK, but I think that the plot may have been a little too clever at the time. It would've been better if it had just become a bit more logical. Maybe the plot would have just proved that maybe it wasn't a cheesy story and that there was something interesting about the people involved. ",0
111," Unfortunately this story is one of those that anyone can tell you interesting facts about as well as the plot twists and turns of the plot. Unfortunately if you don't enjoy the characters it's not worth reading, even if it's a great movie. I recommend it to everyone who reads this site.<br /><br />If you are looking for something to watch out of this",0
112," I'm not really a fan of the project, but I have been a huge fan of the show for years now. This movie was like that and it was not done right. The driving force behind it is a woman whose husband is on his deathbed as she carries out a crazy twist on a project she is supposed to be working on. ",0
113," ...this is just rubbish and really doesn't deserve to be aired on television. If you have to find something BAD about a movie, it is done better than this. I understand that the movie makers of this movie had to make a comedy, and that is what they did. but there is not enough comedy in this movie to keep it on the air. It is not",0
114," I was initially attracted to this movie by the title and how it looked like a straight up slasher film. Well, I'm not sure if I was ever completely fooled as the story of the movie is completely different one. It's not a true slasher film but in the way that you can tell a movie is what it is because the script is full of different twists",0
115, A good comedy about a group of three misfits. It is a somewhat predictable and would suit any comedy audience that would enjoy the idea of a group of people that are not like them but lacking in all the things they are like. ,0
116," This movie is so bad, I can't even rationalize my evil past to honestly believe I would have anything to do with it. When I got home from work I checked this movie on YouTube and was shocked to see how horrifying this is. The movie is trying to be so good from start to finish, but it falls apart very quickly at the sight of the vampires.",0
117," this movie is based loosely on the book of the same name. In this movie the characters are trying to figure out who they are - the immortal Tim, the human Kingpin, the vampire Bugsy, and all the others that make up the cast. ",0
118, I had no idea that I actually was watching a movie. The cast is great and their stunts were amazing (and I am a huge adrenaline junkie) but the only thing I found really funny was the way the sadistic gothic afterlife department acted bovarally and hilariously. ,0
119," The story unfolds in the first half of this film. It is a good thriller with a great cast and great dialogue. The script got a little more complicated than the first film, but that did not affect the movie at all. ",0
120, Read the reviews and tell me to fuck off. ,0
121, I pretty much hated this movie and anyone who read this review will get my small point of view on it. I thought this a great movie with a very talented cast. Well I'm not one for horror movies and this was not for me. It was less intense and had a very slow start. It was easy to relax and I have. I had fun watching it.,0
122," I know what I am talking about here. They were all bad. I am a big fan of the Bill Burr series ""Bill Burr's Laugh account of life"", but this movie dragged me down in the middle. Let's say it should have been a 5 star movie but it's off. I watched the first 30 minutes and then it was all downhill from there. I",0
123," This movie is trash, and I don't know why people keep buying it. It's an interesting concept, but it's such a waste of our time.<br /><br />It's a pretty cool concept at least.<br /><br />It's just not worth the time to actually see the movie because it's so dull. ",0

125," This movie is about the aftermath of a nuclear attack. I'm not sure if it was Howard Gordon's idea or a sort of a plan, but it's a very strange affair. That's the first thing you think. After hearing the story, I am convinced that it was a really bad idea. The script is so bad that it's impossible to get past the fact",0
126," This movie is a pukefest. I'm not a fan of The Cloverfield phenomena making an appearance, but this movie is garbage. It seems like every time The Cloverfield phenomenon appears in a movie, they get them to do something else to make it better. I'm not going to say that this is a bad movie because I'm not one to give people crap",0
127," First off, I don't like the movie. Secondly, I have no idea what this is about. Don't waste your time. Unless you are into horror or cheesy suspense, this is not really worth your time. ",0
128," When I heard that this movie was horror, I was so nervous.<br /><br />This is a big waste of everyone's time. The only reason to watch it is to see what a blatant rip off of horror movies are. But, a movie like this is so bad, I don't care for it at all. ",0
129," I was a huge fan of this movie. I thought that the plot was original and has some good twists and turns. The dialogue was really good, the music was a combination of modern and traditional. Good things are still not enough, but it was a great movie. ",0
130," I wanted nothing more than to watch this movie with all the other people in the theater for the first half of it. It was amazing to see people reacting to the movie. It had a few good laughs as well as some bad ones. I think it was bad on the bad guys part, but it had some good things for the good guys as well. The first half",0
131, This was absolutely horrible. Just let me say that I don't really care if I'm wrong. I am a bit of a nihilist and this movie was a complete waste of my time. It was so bad that I can't take it anymore.<br /><br />I would have gladly paid for the remaining 2 hours of the movie if it was a movie of,0
132," This is by far the worst ever movie to ever be made, or ever shown on television, simply because it is stupid. Seriously. There is no other word to describe it. It is without a doubt the most amateur movie I have ever seen, I can't count how many times I've seen what looked like a film from the 1960's but didn't really look that",0
133," This is the absolute worst movie ever. Horrible, horrible, horrible. It was boring, rude, and, worst of all, stupid. It was so stupid that it was as though nothing really happened. ",0
134," I started out with the greatest expectations from the movie. Then, I realized that it was actually terrible. The cast was definitely good enough to put me off and the movie was just completely awful. I'm not sure if this movie is going to cause me to change my opinions about the horror genre in general, but I don't think I will ever watch a horror film again",0
135," Not only is this a terrible movie, but the digital copy will not play in my computer either.<br /><br />I'm going to have to cancel all my subscriptions to hear this movie in a theater.<br /><br />I received this movie at a flea market with a coupon for a good deal. I am now in no way responsible for its ratings",0
136, I watched this movie with no idea what it was about beforehand. I was intrigued for the first whole hour.<br /><br />I loved the music in this movie. I really felt the eerie vibe in this movie. I have nothing to compare it to. It's a great soundtrack. I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />I found this movie very offensive,0
137," If the title is bringing any attention to this movie, this is definitely not it. It's not that the movie is bad; it's that the movie is bad without a star to give it credit. If you are okay with that, then it's not really that bad. So if you are a person who likes the idea of vampires in the first place, then this",0
138," This movie was really good. The cast was excellent. The movie was funny and the storyline kept my attention. Unfortunately the acting was way too mediocre for the first 15 minutes. I would have given it 3 stars, but I think the 3 stars is way too low. ",0
139," This is the movie I will be watching next and I'm going to be absolutely convinced that it's a masterpiece.<br /><br />Before I enjoyed this film, I saw all of the other vampire movies. All of them were terrible and none of them even remotely resembled this. I really wish the rest of the world would take the time to watch the rest of the",0
140," This review of the TCM Channel's ""12-Hour Of Horrors"", of course, deals with the movie's concept and not the actual film, which is simply terrible.
