" I saw this movie in the theater and as soon as it was over I was asking myself what happened? It was a boring, depressing, and pointless movie. The movie is slow and relies on cheap tricks to keep the audience interested. I really don't understand how this movie was made and how it got so well rated. It just doesn't deserve all of the credit it",0
" Many of you would know that I am a big fan of westerns, but not the traditional kind with lots of shoot-em-up action. This film is not for those who require a heavy dose of action to like a film. There is virtually no action, with a few gunfights and one or two fistfights. Instead, we get the early life of guns",0
" A great movie based on a true story of a phenomenal woman, this was a great movie. The acting is terrific and the story well told. Grifasi and Rush give excellent performances and you will not be disappointed if you see this film. Also, if you like seeing the Mediterranean coastline, you will enjoy the scenery, even if you've been to that area. There",0
" I succumbed to the hype. I was expecting a little more than the usual horror flick that ends up being too predictable.

" This is one of the better films of the year, but that is not saying a whole lot. I remember the first time I saw this title in the 1980s, and I was surprised at the impact that it had on me at that time. It is certainly not Hitchcock's best, but it's a good film-one of his best after an off couple of years",0
" Michael Douglas is not a bad actor. He's just not a great one. He's not even a good one. This is the third time I've seen him in a picture, and the third time that I was wholly disappointed in the results. I don't know what he is doing--he's not a bad man, he's not a bad actor. He's",0

" Leonardo DiCaprio's first major directorial effort is a mediocre action movie with good cast and good action. The story is about a widower, who is a disgraced former CIA operative, who is on the run from a ruthless Wall Street businessman, who was the former CIA operative's boss, who wants to kill him. DiCaprio is a bland hero who is",0
" Well, the first 10 minutes of this film were made by a director who knew nothing about film. Scenes that would have been interesting were played as dull and static despite good acting from the two main characters. The film begins with an awkward court case that seems more like a real-life clip from a political documentary than a film. Then, the film's pace is slow and",0

" I absolutely detest this movie. It is truly one of the worst pieces of garbage in movie history. Both this movie, and its predecessor are nothing more than a bunch of lame, boring excuses for a movie. The only reason this movie was made is because the producers were too cheap to pay for a real plot, or script writers. It is truly a shame that Joel",0

" This movie was very disappointing to me. It seemed heavily marketed for a genre movie, but it turned out to be a B-movie. The acting was bad, the plot line was too limited, and the movie dragged along. I have watched more than a few B-movies and I had a good time with them. This one I did not enjoy. I suggest",0

ever seen a horror movie this bad. It was like watching 6 1/2 hours of a

a crack team of writers and real actors.<",0

" Good idea but poorly executed. I can only recommend it to anyone who is exceptionally bored, and has already seen everything else.<br /><br />The plot is uninspired. The acting is just plain bad. And the special effects - in the times of gritty computer animation - are simply laughable. In other words, you may as well burn the money instead of spending it",0

" You would think that after the success of the first two Godfather movies that the third movie would be something special, but boy, was I wrong.

" I agree very poor movie, and while the killing is not as graphic as some slasher movies it is still bloody. There is nothing scary about this movie, just a boring movie. No ghost or anything actually evil just people killing for no reason. If you want a real horror movie try any of the 3 'Texas Chainsaw' movies, 'The Shining' or the",0
" I have watched this movie twice and i have to say that i dont think its that good. It is obvious to me that the director took his inspiration from 'Evil Dead' and 'Army of Darkness'. It does not compare to either of those classics. It has a few good gags, but i am not sure it is worth the price of renting it. I would",0

Instead, it has some of the silliest martial arts you will ever see. The first fight goes on for what seems like 25 minutes. The script is laughable, and even the",0
" This movie is.... nice. It 's a typical American production of a sweet guy who wins the young lady's heart. It 's not a comedy, but it's not too over the top. The same goes for the romance, there is no overacting. The story is pleasant, but not much original. On the other hand, it's a nice, feel",0
" Getting around in the jungle with a machete, cutting off the heads off of men and chopping off a tiger's tail is always interesting to see. This time the jungle is just in the background of the movie. All the action is on the road in a big truck. The great scenery and the beautiful women (dressed in black leather) make this a good start",0
" This movie is very quiet to be called a 'action movie'. The lack of action and the monotonous sound of the movie make this movie very boring. Especially the lack of action makes it predictable and slow. The movie is centered around one character and one location. So Tom Cruise is the only thing to see. His character is very good, but this is not enough",0
" I really liked the first two movies. I saw this one, and thought that it is a good movie, but i don't like it as the first two. First of all, Danny DeVito is not a good choice for Frank Cross, and David Cross isn't in this one, as far i remember. Second, the story is not that exiting as the first two",0
" The movie has a mediocre concept, with great actors. And it has a dumb title. The story is not that good, some good ideas, but the overall feeling is very dark and negative. I think I would like to see it in a different way, without all that negativity. ",0
" What is the use of acting in a movie if you can't change anything in the movie? I'll score this movie with one star only for the actors, because they tried to give some interest. Otherwise, this is a plain bad movie where the story is so weak and the action is so lame that you can't even realize if there is a plot. I would recommend",0
" The single most over hyped movie of my lifetime. I went to this movie with the highest of expectations, but I left more than a little disappointed. It makes me wonder how much of the movie was improvised. It seems as though there could have been some more organization. ",0
" This movie is very exciting until the end, when it becomes very slow and boring. You can predict the end of the movie before the middle of the movie. The bad guy seems so evil, but at the end, his true intention seems to be good. Only when you see the villain in his true sense, you will find him to be too weak, and the different",0
" A film about the battlefield is always an interesting one. But this film is just too superficial. Everything is too easy, as if the director wanted to say: ""Look I can make a war film and this is how it should look."" The battlefield sounds are over the top at times, the movie is too quiet, the music is too loud. The dialogues are not",0
" Personally, I regret I had to waste my money on this movie. It's not that the special effects are bad or the acting is not at a high level, but the idea is just so plain and any viewer with a little bit of imagination and a good memory will be able to predict what will happen next. The story is about a couple who moves to a new place",0
" Take a story that doesn't amaze with originality. Add some bad acting. How about some cheesy effects? Now you have ""The Thirteenth Warrior"". How can you expect anything more than a disaster when a movie is directed by John McTiernan and produced by Joel Silver? I don't want to start about the annoying music score. The only good thing about",0
" If Oliver Stone would have only put his two hands together here, this would have been a fine movie. As it is, this movie is boring. It is not only the story, as every story can be interesting. (I'll watch something like this even if it is out of a comic strip, if it is interesting) First and foremost, it is the script,",0
" There is nothing in this movie which was not done before. The picture is a bit too slow and boring for this type of movie. Unfortunately, sometimes it's too intense. The story is obviously a copy of other movies. Even the music is a copy from another movie (CASINO). Clearly, Mr. Gere is a nice guy, but he is just too",0
" No, I won't. Just because you have big budgets doesn't mean you can make a good movie. This movie proves the opposite. The plot is ridiculously silly. The actors were clearly paid to act. I have seen better effects in ""I, Robot"" or ""The Day After Tomorrow"". The concept is not a new one, and I have seen better examples of",0

" Who would have thought that a movie made by a rap producer would actually be one of the best films about growing up and lacking direction in the inner city? I can't remember if I've written this before, but I had to write a paper on this and doing research I came across a lot of criticism for this film, but the two main complaints seem to be that it",0
" It has a great idea at the heart of it, but it just feels like it's lacking something. The directing is a little sloppy and it tries to do a lot with its story, but only succeeds in breaking its heart. The main problem lies in all the characters. There are too many to get to know, and it feels like the film is just trying to be",0
" I'm a fan of Guy Maddin, and follow his work closely, having seen all his films. This is by far his best work, and I'm not just saying that because a lot of it is shot in Winnipeg, where I was born. The premise is pretty simple, but the complexity of the way its shot, acted, and scored by Carl Petersen is what",0
" Almost as good as the first. It has the same great characters, more great music, and a lot more action and adventure. The films are really criminally underrated. ",0
" Overall a pretty enjoyable martial arts movie with some good battles. Kinda mind numbing though and doesn't have a lot to say, or at least not in the way it presents its story. It starts out really interesting, but a lot of it is spent on establishing the main characters. Its very well done with the action, and the humor is really good, and Marc",0
" This is my favorite film ever, so I hope you don't mind me putting it up. The very first time I saw it I wasn't expecting much because I was expecting it to be as great as the book, but I was surprised to find that it was even better. Coppola does a fantastic job at turning Puzo's book into film, and it",0
" This film is downright amazing. It combines all the energy of Trainwreck, Amy Schumer, the humor/atrocity of The Farrelly Brothers, and the raw emotional power of William Forsythe, and it's all tied together with a pretty solid story. It's long and at times feels like it's dragging. The truth is, that actually works for it here",0
" The acting is pretty good, though the plot is similar to many other films, this one doesn't really offer anything new. It doesn't really have anything special to offer either. Based on the way Robert Rodriguez works this is probably practically a home movie. According to his commentary it is, and it seems like he was just interested in making a movie that his kids would like",0
" This is a pretty good movie, and one I really liked. It's pretty unique in its execution, it's not your typical feel good, rags to riches story, which is the main thing I wanted to say about it. The story is actually pretty good considering the fact that it's nothing but a premise, and it ends up being pretty emotional as well. The",0
" Terribly boring. It's a very average film, with bad acting and story. I don't recommend it at all. ",0
" There is a part of the film where they show the stunt double for the actor who plays two characters (one being the main one, and the other being the stunt double) and he looks EXACTLY like the actor.

I have a feeling that this is going to get a lot",0
" This is a film about a young man (Brandon Fraser) who has had a, frankly, boring life. He is a super-duper real estate agent, who is trying to get a promotion, and to do this he must sell a house. Problem is he has to sell this house to some hippies(probably the only real people in the film), and they",0
" Anybody who follows American cinema even a little knows that Hollywood is obsessed with remaking and reimagining classic stories. Most of the time they don't get it right, unless it was a remake in the first place. This time, the story of the classic novel A Star is Born by William Wellman is given the Hollywood ""treatment"" and it's hard to think",0
" This movie is the epitome of low brow, dumb fun. A big step up from the first two which were both very predictable, and this is still no masterpiece, but I do like that they went out and tried something different for this one.
