" ""The Last Face"" is a movie that may be classified as the best or the worst of the many Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw films.

 This is a film that you will either love or hate. I loved it! Five stars! I have surmised that this is the greatest film ever made.

As the movie started out, the dialog was rather boring, and I",0

It's sad that such a promising actor as Liev Schrieber is in such an AWFUL, annoying, film. Just awful. It is the ACTUAL definition of a 'guilty pleasure', when",0

 I think that this movie is very good. It tells a lot about the past about the time when people were less civilized. I didn't really like the way they had the horses being followed around. It sort of ruined the movie and made it less interesting. I think that Gregory Peck is a wonderful actor. I can't believe that he made so many movies. I can,0

 This is a really good but kind of sad movie. I like it because it is sort of like a fantasy. I think it is just about a girl who has a horrible life and wants to get away.

" I don't know what was the most awful thing about this movie. If you want to see a movie without a plot, buy a lot of expensive popcorn, find a comfortable spot to sit, and watch lots of pretty pictures revolving around the love story between a young couple. You might even fall asleep, because it's so boring. If you want to see a mystery,",0
" I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was unique and I enjoyed the story. The effects were great, the story was well done and the actors pulled off a lot more ""layers"" than I expected. I thought I was going to be bored but was I ever wrong. It was an adventure that kept me guessing and wanting to see what would happen next",0
 This film was so bad it wasn't even funny. I rented this one thinking that a horror film about a killer doll would be right up my alley. I was wrong. This was one of the worst movies I have seen. The bad guy toy was just pathetic. The plot was stupid. I just wish I had stayed home and watched some of the other scary movies available,0

" This movie is ok. But I wouldn't pay to see it. I first thought that it was just average but as it went on it got worse. I'm a fan of films like ""the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" and ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" but I can't say that this one is my favorite. The actors are",0
" ""I Vitelloni"" is a lovely, sad film about lost youth, about a group of young men hanging out together in the 1950s, feeling bored and restless, and about the women they are attracted to and bed, and the women who are attracted to and bed them. The movie has wonderful, often humorous, sometimes touching moments, but I think the overall",0

So they get a private investigator to find out. The investigator is a very stupid",0
" This is the worst movie I ever saw. Not even worth it for a laugh. A friend of mine and I rented it and thought it would be funny. It was so bad we had to turn it off. You get to a point in the movie where you want to stop watching it, but then you think, ""there's no way this movie can get worse.""",0
" I was completely disappointed with this movie. Although I didn't have high expectations, I was still hoping for some sort of plot to be there. But there's nothing, just some flashbacks, flashbacks of the flashback and then some flashbacks of the flashbacks of the flashbacks. It's just boring and uninteresting. When the end comes, I'm surprised. I'm surprised that it",0
" This movie is a very good one, if you don't know the ending. I like this movie because it is funny, and it is one of them movies that you don't know the ending. That is one of the things that I like. So if you like that type of movie then you should really watch this movie. Another thing that I like about this movie is",0
" This is the worst movie I've ever seen. It made no sense and the writing was awful. I have never seen a movie with so many pointless scenes where nothing happens. Even the scene where they find the ""cure"" for the disease was pointless. I would have given this movie zero stars if that were an option. The acting was lackluster and the script... well",0
" What you have here is a whole lot of scares, some laughs, some gore, some nudity, and a whole lot of funny. This was one of the best horror films in the 80s (and maybe even in the 90s). The story really isn't that good. It's about this team of commandos (including an ex-president of the U.S",0
" If you can get past the poor VHS transfer, you'll find this a fun little exploitation flick. I'm the perfect audience for this movie because I love lurid schlock from the 70s. Sure, the picture quality is pretty bad, and the dubbing is a little off, but overall, this film is a fun little romp that you can fast-",0
" I know it's not the best out there, but it was the first movie I ever saw with Rosanna Arquette (and that's good enough for me), so I give it an extra star. I also love the scene when they're at the beach house & she's humming the song that she sang when she performed under the name ""novelty act""",0
" This film was quite amusing, but like some of the other films reviewed on this site; I cant figure out why it's seen as a classic. It's a comedy, but not the type that will leave you rolling on the floor. It's a short film, but did not achieve the goal of quick laughs. Perhaps in it's day it was well liked, but",0

 A very nice movie. It's not really a horror film. It's more like a science fiction fantasy. Vincent Price is a nice actor. It's really a good movie to sit down and enjoy.

" This movie is an interesting example of the way US culture assimilates foreign mythic material, or simply steals from it, and then recasts it in a new format.

" I've never been a fan of Eddie Murphy. He's a very hit-or-miss actor, but when he hits he hits hard. ""48 Hours"" is a perfect example of this; it's one of his best films. In ""Coming To America"" he mixes a little fat and a little skinny to come out with a piece of Hollywood cheese. The film",0
" This movie sucked. It's cliche. You can predict everything that's going to happen. there's nothing new about it. It's just a bunch of kids trying to find a treasure out in the woods. Oh yeah, and the scary voice over the walkie-talkie! How original. I can't believe they actually made a movie about this. I mean",0
" In 5 words: unoriginal, predictable, stupid, cheesy, cheap. This is the kind of movie that almost made me regret seeing such a great cast wasted in a film like this. I mean come on! It's got Rutger Hauer, Ron Perlman, Malcolm McDowell and and some other actors that I don't know but who are famous. I thought",0
 I love it when Valentina is being a sex kitten in this video. The complete reverse is also too much to take for me.

 This movie is nothing but a waste of time. I'm all for a movie with a great plot and characters that you can care about but most of the movie is boring.

" I was really looking forward to seeing this movie because of the cast and the reviews I had read. I thought it would be interesting, a real thriller. But, it was just absolutely terrible, it was one of the worst movies I had ever seen in my life. I was so disappointed. This movie is highly overrated. It is a huge waste of time, money",0

" I first discovered this movie in 1992, when it was released on VHS. At the time, it was considered somewhat of a ""classic"" and a lot of people had claimed it was one of the best horror movies ever made.

 When I purchased this movie I did not know what it was about. Then I read the description above about a movie that is a love story and then I realized that it was not what I was expecting.

She teams up with a rough-",0
 It's hard to believe that this was made for TV. It is a perfectly written and acted movie. As a matter of fact it's perfect in every way. I highly recommend this movie. I won't waste your time writing a big review because there's not much to say. All I know is that everyone that watches this movie will love it. ,0
" Great movie, a lot of what you'd expect from a John Carpenter film however I enjoyed the nods to past films that he made. It's not a very long movie so the pacing of the film is quite fast.

 While watching this film I had to laugh at the fact that this is a film about the near future and it is already dated. Visually speaking the film is really good and for it's time it's not bad but it's way too dated to be considered a great film today.<br /><br />The plot is a very simple one.

 This movie is a must see for anyone who is interested in history. The story is based on the actual events of the cold war. An honest to god romance between a Russian spy and an American soldier.

 When I went to see this with my two friends we didn't know what to expect. We expected it to be like Twiligt or something because of the girl on the cover.

" The first time I heard about this movie was when I read in some book about 1970's sexploitation movies.

" I like comedy films, especially British comedy. This film had a good review. It had some good actors. It is a British film. So I thought I would like it. However, it was terrible.

 I love this movie. Every time I watch it I laugh at the same things over and over again. I love the scene when the three guys are discussing the poo-biscuit in the bathroom of the hotel in Las Vegas. I love the fight scene when the Travolta and Cage characters have an argument in the kitchen of the same hotel. I love,0
" First of all, let me say that I am not a fan of this type of film at all. But I do enjoy films of this calibre when they are done well. This is not one of those films. First of all, I have to say that the best part of this movie is the character of Garp (Robin Williams). He is very real, honest",0

" The film was well done, but there were some things that I thought could have been avoided. It could have been more serious, and not have the talk show host laughing at the movie. With that said, this was a great film, the special effects are amazing, what I liked most about this movie is that it takes a couple of murders that happened in the 70's",0

 This movie was so retarded it was almost un-watchable. I had to leave the room. The plot was so stupid and full of holes. The characters were so forgettable. The acting was the worst I've ever seen. No one in this film is an actor. This is just a movie. You wouldn't watch it again. It is that way. I,0

The plot is stupid, the characters are stupid, and the one character that wasn't stupid was replaced by a stupider character. I don't know why this was made either. The director must have been on drugs",0

" This movie is pretty much a ripoff of your typical slasher film. Except for the lack of blood and guts, this movie is pretty much the same as there is a killer, who wears a black hoodie with the hood up (I guess it's some sort of sick joke) and he has a sick sense of humor. Well, these types of movies are what",0

 I am not usually in to this kind of movies but since Jet Li is my favorite martial artist of all time I decided to check it out hoping for the best. I was pleasantly surprised with the film. Jet Li is one of the best martial artists in the world and he did a great job as always. The action is great and the storyline is much better than most of,0
" OK, This movie was utter crap. I am a pretty easy to please guy when it comes to horror movies, but this one just made me say to myself repeatedly ""What the F***?"" It was not scary, the effects were bad, and the writing was awful. I've always liked movies about monsters in the sea, but this movie was just a waste of time",0
" If you liked the first two installments of this movie, you will love this one. It's like they took the first two movies, added to it, and made a third.

" This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. If you go into this movie expecting a gripping tale of mystery, you will be sorely disappointed. If, like me, you go in expecting a comedy, then you will have a great time. While the first 25 minutes of the film has a bit of a slow pace, it begins to pick up quickly. By",0
 This is not a very good movie. I believe that modern horror movies should be more serious and suspenseful.<br />The only thing scary about this movie was its poster. ,0

The movie was billed as a comedy, but it did not have a",0

" The first time I watched this movie I was thinking, ""What the heck did I just watch?"" I found the movie rather confusing. I watched it again and I still did not get it. I definitely don't recommend watching this movie. It is not good at all. Instead of having a plot, they just throw together a bunch of random scenes.<br /><br",0

I knew from the very beginning that this movie would be bad",0
 2 words - DON'T SEE THIS!<br /><br />Farfetched and faulty. This is an amature filmmaker's attempt at a 3rd world war action picture.

" This is my favorite film of all time! I can watch this everyday and never get tired of it! It is the story of two guys who go in search of their missing friend and after a long search they realise that he was and still is their friend. It has a very good story, good actors and is very enjoyable! <br />This film comes from the heart",0
 I liked this movie not because of Hayden Christensen but because of Cam Gigandet. I didn't want to see the movie but I did. Cam Gigandet was very good in it and so was everybody else. It was a pretty good movie. I liked the ending. I think the movie is okay and I recommend it to people who want to see something that is,0
" Very disappointing sequel. The story is very much like the first film, which is good because in my opinion the original is one of the best films of all time.<br /><br />The story is set in New York and the city where the first film took place. But that's where the similarities end. The film is set in the 80s and the era of",0
" I'm not a fan of any of the characters in this movie. They are all so irritating and I cannot stand them. Even though it is a good movie, it has been ruined by a lot of annoying characters. This was my first and only date movie with my boyfriend, and I was completely embarrassed by how angry I got at how annoying they were. They are all",0
" Well, I don't know why critics hate it so much, I think this movie is really good. I don't really care for the whole ""twilight"" series, but this movie is really good. Better than I expected. The story was good, and it was unique, although the first vampire goes a little far, I say. It's young, and the",0
" I was a big fan of the first movie, but I was very dissapointed with this one. It was very boring, the special effects looked terrible and it had no real storyline to it. The acting was bad too, you could see that the actors were just going through the motions. The only good parts were the parts in the beginning, but after the first 20",0
 I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good laugh. It's a very funny movie and I am surprised that it wasn't a real big hit. I am so glad I rented it off of iTunes. This movie is like a dark and funny comedy. It has a good cast of actors and actresses. I think the only thing I didn't like about this movie,0
 The pacing is slow and boring. The plot is thin and predictable. The characters' motives are simple and cliche. The dialogue is uninspiring. I couldn't even sit through the whole film. I could not find a one single thing that drew me in or made me want to continue watching. It's to bad because the cast is nice. The actors are nice,0
" In the post-apocalypse, there is a war going on between two factions, and a young woman in a red dress is trying to break the stalemate. Set in a bombed out London, she pursues a young soldier and attempts to ""make a difference"" on the ground, when the powers that be don't seem to be making headway. The film is",0
" To start off, I never hear a good word about this movie. As a little kid, I knew this to be the little girl version of those horror movies I would watch with my dad, like Nightmare on Elm Street and Spawn (the live action one). I was blinded by the ""Coolness"" of the cover and the films premise, and I bought it used.",0
 this is the worst movie ive ever seen. And i have seen lots of movies. Me and my friends rented this one a wendsday evening. Man we had lots of fun. This movie is the worst most boring crap ive ever seen. But it makes you laugh! U will lay on the floor rolling around tryin to get some air. You wonder why,0
" A movie that is so bad it's good! I couldn't help but laugh out loud (and to my surprise my wife did as well) with all of the ridiculous antics of the main character and the supporting characters! Kids might enjoy it as well, but for adults be forewarned, it's a real trip. Just don't expect a great movie and you won",0
" From the director of My Bloody Valentine and Fright Night comes this beautifully crafted remake of the classic horror tale. Unlike the original, which only used the basic elements of the story; the original characters names, the hotel and the promise of the visit of a doctor famous for his ability to cure alcoholism, the story here has much more depth. In this version, we follow Dr",0
