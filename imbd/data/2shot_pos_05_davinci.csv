" Watching this movie is like being inside a nightmare that you can't wake up from. In other words, it's an experience that leaves you completely drained. It's a painful look at how family members can betray one another and at the same time inflict psychological pain and make each member suffer psychologically.<br /><br />The pace is slow. Some people may not like that",1
" There are many reasons to admire this film, not the least of which is its key role in the career of a young director named Martin Scorsese. I speak of the legendary director of Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The Last Temptation of Christ, among dozens of others. But he also made Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, which is",1
 It is rare to see a film that is so completely amazing on virtually every level. To say that GONE BABY GONE is the best film to come out this year would not be an exaggeration. It is a masterpiece. The acting is pitch perfect. The writing is superb. The direction is genius. And the whole package is film making at its finest. <,1
" Are we really surprised that the guy who brought us ""Bad Santa"" is making a movie about little league baseball? Not here at the HOB. We've been expecting it all along. If ""CBB"" is ""A Christmas Story"" for grown-ups, then ""Kicking and Screaming"" is ""Bad News Bears"" for grown-ups. Not a",1
" I've read several reviews of this movie that have mentioned problems with the editing of the film. I'm going to come out and say it. This is one of the best edited films I have ever seen. The editing is like a David Lynch film, and that's a great thing. Throughout the film, the editing adds to the poetic strangeness of the story, and",1
" I don't know how accurate this story is of the Gulf War in 1991, but I'm pretty sure it wouldn't pass the censors today. I mean, no way would war be allowed to produce the sex that's in this film. For more than a decade since it was first produced, on its original release in '68, this picture was unseen, except for",1
" Only the third time I've seen this, and the first for a while. An odd, inventive, and fully engaging black comedy. The way it keeps up the pressure and the momentum from start to finish is pretty amazing. It was a cult favorite when it came out, and it still deserves to be seen by any and all. ",1
" I have seen this movie many times and each time I see it, I go away from the movie loving it even more and I always want to see it again. I know this is a movie that would never be a blockbuster and it is one of those movies that I feel will be appreciated more as it ages. I know that this is a movie that went largely unnoticed when",1
" Here's a movie that everyone in America should see. A story of great injustice, told in a way that could possibly make a difference in people's lives. The humanity presented here is very real, very genuine, and it's very moving. The acting is superb, especially by the four people who are given the major roles. Each of these four gives a fine performance.",1
" I saw this again today, in its new GK restoration, and it's still equally brilliant. The fact that it's even more stunning and evocative today than when it was new is a testament to the achievement of Bergman and cinematographer Gunnar Fischer. The film is a tour de force of emotion and symbolism, with an unforgettable performance by Max von Sydow",1
" Well, I must say, this is the best movie of this year. It is an excellent work, accomplished in a rare combination of refreshing humor and serious drama. It has a very beautiful view of life, and I like its main idea - instead of going for the happy end, it starts from the wrong and makes things right. I am sure that there are many people",1
" The final (so far) entry in the 'Look at the freakin' wacky adventures of this crazy ass movie star' sub-genre. And it's most certainly good for a laugh, and even more so for a cry.<br /><br />It's a risky movie, in that it's a cocktail of almost nothing but pure corn, and it never",1
" We all know how those fairy tales go. Girl meets boy. Girl & boy fall in love and live happily ever after. What kind of a fairy tale would that be? The opposite! When a (sexy) teenaged girl (newcomer, Jena Malone) meets a (lonely) redneck (Samuel L. Jackson), the two fall",1
" Weak story that is only saved by the chemistry between the two leads.<br /><br />This movie had so much potential to be a better movie, but fell short of it. The main problem with the movie was the main character. The main character wasn't interesting at all. The main character spoke in a slow monotone voice that made him sound like he was",1
" It's probably the only time I've seen an actor being so prominently featured in the ad campaign, but not in the actual film. This was actually a really good movie. I'm told that there was a lot of pre-production work done on this. That it was written as a novel, and that the director, Frank Darabont, wanted to film it as",1
" I think the film deserves a 10 because clearly there was deep thinking involved in this movie. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I loved it. Yes, there was too much sex, but I don't think it was gratuitous. This movie was a play on the old way of writing the bible. It was about the humanization of the bible and making",1
" Bit of a mixed bag for me here. The use of locations and backdrops throughout are subtle yet effective, making this highly low-key and realistic kind of thriller work effectively well. The lighting and cinematography are great as always, although I'm not sure about the look of the creatures; I'm sure they're really good CGI but they're not up to the standards",1
" And then there's the cinema: you'll never see a better visual representation of the range of music than in this movie. There's the eerie, ghost-filled scenes with a fan-driven, revolving drum set; there's the crisp, clean, almost clinical cellos; there's the careening, frenetic, multi-instrumental jams; there's the",1

I feel like I could make the rounds of a few friends' houses (and make them watch it with me, too) and then have drinks and discuss the film afterward. I love the lush look of this",1
" A movie about stoners can be fun, but a movie about smart stoners can be a whole different thing. This is a movie about smart stoners who are not just all talk, but who are willing to take action.

 I watched Legacy of the 500th Night today and was surprised to discover it was a very good movie. I've always loved Sinatra so this was a treat. I watched it with my children and they thought it was great as well. I highly recommend it. ,1
 I just watched this movie and I thought it was really good. The movie is about a family that has a little boy named Billy. Billy is kidnapped by a serial killer who kills teenagers and then leaves a doll behind. The family is crazy about the doll and Billy's dad made a very big deal about how your brother was the one who gave it to you and he told,1
 I had a wonderful time seeing this amazing movie again. I loved seeing a small Alaskan town in the winter months. It was so much fun seeing the characters and their personalities. I love the small town feelings and the way the people interact with each other. It happens alot in small towns. I thought that the storyline was great. This movie really shows how people in,1
 I Believe this is one of John Wayne's best westerns! Not to take away anything from any other of his movies. But I believe this is his best one. I love the true story behind this movie. I have enjoyed the movie thoroughly for years. I believe this movie should be on DVD's. Thank you for the opportunity to give my opinion. ,1
" Pretty good movie. There is a good plot with the mystery scenes and the ending. I will watch this movie over and over again. Michael Madsen plays his part very well in this movie. So if you can catch this movie on the Lifetime Movie Network, do so. It is worth watching. ",1
" This is an awesome movie!! It is about a monster who is responsible for the deaths of multiple people. One night he goes to kill a woman in a house and the woman's son comes to the rescue and saves her. The mother wants to take the son away so he is not in danger, so she writes a letter to get him a job on a ship that is",1
" In a nod to 'High Noon,' Sinatra plays a newlywed whose outlaw brother (Dillon) has just escaped from prison and intends to return to the town where he was raised. The town's Marshal (Conrad) goes after the outlaws with the help of the townspeople. In this role, Sinatra plays a character similar to that of Ethan Edwards",1
" I've been waiting for the DVD release of this little gem for years. I had a vhs copy and always wanted a copy to watch over and over. Well, my patience has paid off. This is one of my favorite Westerns. I can't think of a single bad thing to say about it. Everything works: cast, directing, music, photography. Just",1
 I really enjoyed this movie. I thought the acting was fantastic and really had an old western feel to it. The plot was pretty good and I didn't see the ending coming. So overall I really enjoyed watching this movie and I recommend it. ,1
" Burt Lancaster's career didn't get off to a great start. His very first film,(1945), is a forgotten minor classic. His second film,(1946) was a hit. His third film,(1948), was a big hit. It was produced by his older brother, His fourth film,, was a big flop. His fifth film(",1
" I had the opportunity to see this film last night and I really liked it. Not only was it a good film but it made me consider things about my life and put things in perspective. The main character, Frank, did not want to be an abusive husband and a father that abandoned his family but was a product of his society and his environment. He learned from doing things",1
" Really enjoy watching Lauren Bacall movies, she's was a great actress. One of my favorite movies that I have seen with her was this one. The story is just as good as the cast, very entertaining. A great plot with a great cast. ",1
" This was the first movie I've ever seen twice in the theatre, and I just saw it again tonight. I finally got ""Wide-screen"" DVD. Seeing the film on the big screen with a full orchestra is a must. I never seem to tire of it. This is a movie that always seems to have something new to offer. If you like it once,",1
" This movie is from 1956, directed by Richard Fleischer and starring Ernest Borgnine and Ernest Borgnine and a whole bunch of other cast members. This movie is about this prison bus, it's the prison bus to go up to the prison and they pick up this guy from prison that's suppose to go on his last ride to his execution. The problem is the driver's",1
" This was a very good movie, and I enjoyed watching it. I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys a well made film. The acting is very good and the story is very good. If you like this kind of movie, and you have never seen it, you should watch it. It is a classic, and very enjoyable. ",1
 I watched this one again today and I did like it. It has a really interesting cast and it has no big name stars in it. I think that is what makes it so interesting. The movie came out in the 50's but it has a very modern feel to it. I love the way it was filmed. It could have easily been done today. More films need,1
" It's a bit long and may be a little slow at the beginning, but overall it's a great movie. Both Robert Wagner and Angie Dickinson are great in it, and it's based on a true story. The ending is very touching. If you like westerns, this is highly recommended! ",1
 I LOVE this movie. I saw it when I was 3 and I love it still. I know I have it on VHS but haven't watched it in a while. I believe it is a Lifetime movie. I haven't seen this movie since I was a child though but it is special to me. This movie is excellent. ,1
 I really enjoyed this movie. My daughter had been making fun of me for buying this movie. It was on for a couple of days and I just had to watch it. I really liked it. I love how he tells the story about what happens to him. I like the fact that he is a shy guy and just wants to go to school. He is a little,1
" Yet another gem from TCM! I have seen this movie only once (on late night TV in the early 80's) but it left an impression on me. I was interested to see this again (and to see it in color) and was very pleased by the movie overall. I enjoyed the nostalgic feel of the movie and the story had everything I wanted: romance,",1
 I loved this movie. It was a good mystery & I was on the edge of my seat to the end of the movie. I would definitley watch this movie again. It was so suspenseful & really pulls you into the story & how the killer is getting what he wants. I didn't figure out the killer until the end. I would recommend this movie to,1
" While the people at Lifetime continue to find real life stories and turn them into movies, they have also created a way that they can incorporate a number of these movies into one month of programming. They have created the “A” list (my term) for the month of September. This month I have noticed a trend in movies that Lifetime is airing. They are all",1
" The Whispers is a strong TV drama and thriller that I am really enjoying watching. I know I shouldn't be surprised that my favorite actor Mr. Ryan Phillippe is in it. I think he does a great job as Ben Crawford, a father and husband who is a former cop who is now a teacher. Ben is in a strong marriage with a wife played by",1
" I enjoyed it. I thought the ending was a little predictable, and there were some parts that dragged a bit, but overall I gave it a 9 out of 10.

This is the second time that I've seen it, and it had a very different impact on me the second time around. I found myself much more sympathetic to Billy Warren, which I think helped",1
" Great bit of acting by Al Pacino as a grouchy old man who is forced to confront his past to the point that he is forced to relive something he thought he was done with. Just when you think that all is well for him, his past creeps up on him. Kevin Dillon seemed to be able to portray a nice guy turned to serial killer. I'm",1
" Well, this movie was ok. I actually really liked Alicia Silverstone, I think she's great. I liked how this movie was from the killer's point of view, it was interesting to see. Kevin Dillon I also thought he did pretty good. I liked how it showed the murders from the killer's point of view, and I liked seeing the flashbacks, very cool",1
" Okay, I know I am not supposed to talk about the movie here but I am going to anyway, so don't read this if you haven't seen the movie yet. Rule 1: If you are going to review a movie based on your feelings after seeing it the first time, leave the movie until after you have seen it several more. Rule 2: I know how",1
" This was a good movie. I enjoyed it. I liked the fact that it was a game on who did it. I didn't give the movie 5 stars because the first part of the movie was a bit slow for my likes. But it was good, I would watch it again. I would even go as far as to say it was a good date movie. RE",1
" Oh my gosh, I just watched the DVD last night and I loved it. It's on Netflix so I didn't really know what to expect. But I must say that this movie is amazing. I cried because of the ending. I didn't want it to end. I want more!! But I'm so glad that it has a sequel because the ending leaves you",1
" I've seen this movie many time, and it's not worth watching because of the plot, but because of the actors. It's the cast that made this movie so great. Kevin Dillon and Alicia Silverstone are so cute together, and Kevin gives a good performance as a bad guy. Alicia is also great in this movie. ",1
" In a nutshell, this movie is about two brothers -- the older one is a vampire and the younger one is a werewolf. The older one is in a witness protection program and the younger one is taking care of him until he can testify in court. The older brother is played by David Boreanaz (Angel) and the younger one is played by Tyler Mane (Michael",1
" This movie started out all right, but as it went on it became a little unbelievable. I know that it's based on a true story, but the ending just seemed so far fetched. The movie did have some interesting moments, but overall it wasn't believable. I did like the name of the killer though. It seemed so weird that the guy's last name was",1
" I really enjoyed this movie. I loved Alicia Silverstone in Clueless. I had never seen her in anything else. It was really funny!!! I really liked the ending too. It's not something that happens in a lot of movies. It's a very suspenseful movie, and not a slow boring ending like some movies have. ",1
" I saw this movie tonight on Lifetime Network by accident! I don't usually watch that channel but my husband was mad at me so he made me watch this movie and it wasn't that bad. This movie is about a woman, named Jill Marquette played by Alicia Silverstone who was caught by the FBI in the 1960s for her killing spree because she thought her husband was",1
 I loved this movie. It was definitely my favorite one of the whole series. I don't know why but I love watching movies where they jump back and forth between past and present. And this movie was the best at it. Really kept me on my toes. It was also amazing how they managed to keep this movie a secret from the fans for so long. It was,1
 I have seen this movie and even though I kind of knew who the killer was from the beginning I still liked watching it. I would recommend it to other people. It comes on Lifetime movie network quite a lot. And I am thinking since it's close to Halloween they might play it more. So please be on the look out for it if you are interested in watching it,1
" I did not know what to expect when I picked up this movie. I saw it at the video store and saw that it had Alicia Silverstone in it, and decided to give it a shot. I can tell you that I was pleasantly surprised. The movie has a lot of twists and turns, and as always, the killer is not the person you would expect it to",1
" i think this movie was a great movie to watch. it wasn't boring or anything. its more of a drama/thriller. it wasn't that hard to figure out who the killer was in the movie, even though it was a surprise to me that it was him by the end. im going to read the book now that the movie is over. its amazing",1
 You should see this movie if you have time to watch it. MEANWELL: I love this show. I havent seen it all yet. But the parts I have seen are great. I love the two main characters. They seem to have great chemistry together. It is a cute show and I am excited to see more of it. ,1
" It's not just the puns on the title of this one that are cheesy. There's also a pastiche of ""Singing in the Rain"" (e.g. when the musical numbers start up) and a big fight scene (dressed up as a ballet number) that takes its cues from the Flashdance movie. But this movie is actually pretty fun",1
" I have been an avid reader of Joyce Carol Oates for decades. I read her when she wrote what may have been called ""women's fiction,"" loosely based on her own life, and I've continued to read her now that she has turned to writing about murder and mayhem.

" The story of the founding of Israel is one of the great love stories of the 20th century. It is a stirring tale of idealism, sacrifice, change and, well, love. The story has grown each year in scope and intensity as the generations of Jews who were child survivors of the concentration camps have passed. But it has also become more tragic as the idealism",1
" No, this is not the first ""Laurel and Hardy"" film. It is actually the third. Well, it took about three years for them to break out big.

" Usually, stories about India are like the story of India itself: miserable, oppressed, and depressing. It's a wonder that this movie wasn't the same. But it wasn't.

" The film follows the path of the book fairly closely. Only the opening scene is missing: The car crash is not shown in the film, and the two oldest sons, Brad and Randy, were not in the car at the time of the crash.

" A new version of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" has been made, this time by Francis Ford Coppola.

The latter is",1
" If you think Shakespeare's ""Othello"" is an improbable story, you should read ""The Moor's Last Sigh,"" the novel by Salman Rushdie that the film is based on. It's a delicious work of fiction, one that is hard to believe could have been written by a human, much less a person who was a teen-ager in the 1960's",1
" I have only seen this film once, but it affected me profoundly, and I am eager to see it again. It is so beautifully written, directed, and acted that I'm afraid it will disappoint me upon a second viewing, but I have faith that this is a movie that will somehow transcend time and taste. Indeed, it is the only movie I have ever seen that",1
" There were at least a half dozen silent-film versions of Shakespeare's ""The Merchant of Venice,"" and there have been several television productions.

So when he returned to the director's chair with ""Big Fish,"" you'd expect a fairy tale capable of causing nightmares. Instead, Burton produced a comedy with elements of fantasy, but no supernatural occurrences. This movie was enjoyable for me, even though I might",1
" I like this movie because it lets you see the family dynamic of the people who had the most to gain or lose from the Depression. You see them in their everyday life, doing their best to survive, trying to keep up with what their neighbors are doing, and not being above using a bit of sleight of hand to get ahead. You get a sense of how people",1

" This is the second film I've seen this year from director Lee Chang-dong. (The other was ""Secret Sunshine."") I enjoyed both films very much, and I'm looking forward to seeing more of his work. He has an eye for detail in the little things. He is also able to let us see how his characters think and feel, and I don't",1

You'll be surprised that it's not what you thought it would be and also it",1

I don't normally watch movies with such a high R",1
" A great movie to rent if one is in the mood for a real tear-jerker. A real tear-jerker. One can see this movie for the plot, costumes, and cinematography: the movie is masterfully filmed.

 A friend of mine brought me a copy of this movie and I have watched it over and over since then. I am still not sure if I would recommend this movie to anyone but it sure is something worth seeing. The movie is very unique and takes you to a very deep place. Just don't come looking for something that is easy to digest. The movie is very slow,1

" So I thought I'd give my opinion on this movie. To tell you the truth, I went into this movie expecting one thing, only to be pleasantly surprised. The movie, at least most of it, was really funny. It was just like a modern day version of ""Sixteen candles"" with a little more raunchiness. The characters were well developed and the",1

" After having just rewatched the film for the first time since it originally came out, I'm compelled to comment. It's one of my all-time favorite movies, and I have a feeling that it will always remain in my top-ten list. I grew up in the 70s and 80s, and to my mind, this is pure nostalgia done right.",1

I had the chance to meet Kevin Bacon a couple of years ago and was very impressed with him. I know why after watching this movie. The story of him and the others is a story that has to be seen",1

It was original, smart and entertaining. It's a story about three girls who want to be popular and powerful, and they make a pact to kill someone, anyone. They",1
 The movie was great. It showed the life of inner city ghettos in a way that it was honest and enlightening. I think that Michael Jai White was one of the best actors in the movie. I also liked the amount of humor that he was able to throw into his character as well. I think that this movie will have a positive influence on the young,1
" Is this the same man that made films like ""The Cell"" and ""Dark City""? I can't think of a director who has fallen so low in the wake of his own success as has this guy. He always had films that were a bit obscure, but even there I thought he was a master of his art. Maybe he is just getting too old to keep up",1
" I thought this movie was actually pretty good. The main character was pretty funny and believable. The girl that played the love interest did a good job and the supporting characters were good as well. The plot was a bit predictable but the twist at the end was a suprise. The epilogue was kind of slow going, but overall well worth the rental. ",1
" A really good movie to see. Some parts are a little disturbing but the movie is overall great . The acting is excellent, the sets are very good and the lighting is flawless . The story is also good, you get to know the characters really well before they start to kill each other. You get to know some of their back round stories and this makes you feel sorry for",1
" This Canadian made movie about the computer age is a thought provoking drama that emphasizes the importance of human interaction. It is not a movie about the computer, but as stated by the director, a movie on human relationships. When the computer goes haywire, the knowledge and skills of the human beings are shown to be superior. Good premise and good acting. ",1
" Now, that's a slice of old time action adventure. I hate it when filmmakers try to make period films by using a hot, smooth camera. The picture seemed very hand held, which is great for cutting costs, but the end result gives the picture an ""amateur"" look. I don't mind the odd fuzz in an image, or a bit of a scratch",1
" This was the best movie in the series. It had the best writing, best action, best plot, and best acting by far. It made a point of saying ""You can't kill what doesn't die"" and ""We are the future. You are the past."" It had the best music by far, too. ",1
 This is a great coming of age film set in Ireland in the 1920s. Richard Harris is great as the priest who has lost his faith in God. The cinematography and music are wonderful. Highly recommended!<br /><br />The film's title refers to an ancient Irish legend in which a young child is taken away from his or her parents and returned years later,1

 The third time is the charm! I watched the original and the sequel (both 2 1/2 stars) in the theater and was disappointed.

 This is a classic movie. The first time I saw it was when I was about 14 and was told that I could not watch it.

 Total piece of crap. I knew something bad was coming because they kept introducing us to the characters and then killing them off. They spent the whole movie trying to make these people sympathetic and they had no chance. Way too much of a slow burn and none of the kills were particularly inventive or violent.<br /><br />The main character's girlfriend was the worst. She,1
" The best part of the movie are the scenes with Chris Walken. He's a terrific actor and brings a nice sense of reality to the flick. One sad thing is that there was so much more in the original cut. They should have left in everything, including the scene with the baby, and maybe they would have gotten that R rating. But in my opinion, this",1

" I am not a fan of Sean Penn. I have not liked any of the films he has been in. So in spite of the fact that I was sure I would hate this film (I can't stand his acting), I rented it because I am a big fan of the late River Phoenix (I loved him in Lucas) and I wanted to see how he acted in",1
" Okay, on a Friday night, we watched this movie, and were pleasantly surprised. It was funny and had a good plot. We laughed out loud quite a few times and enjoyed ourselves. This is the kind of movie that makes you want to watch it again. It's not completely serious, and it's funny. It's good. ",1
" This film has great acting, good directing, sound editing, and artistry. The script, though, has some problems. The Russian title is ""Pokhozhdeniye v Tumannyi Mir"" which means ""Journey to the Dark World"", and that's the way the film is structured, with the action in 1939, then a jump to",1
" This is a much better film than I would ever have guessed, with a storyline that doesn't sprawl out too badly, despite being clearly structured for TV movie production. It's somewhat a predictable piece, but the characters and situations are pretty good. One might be temped to say that The Fuzzy Pink Nightgown is a modern cross-dressing comedy,",1
" Four young college students take a train trip to the beach and encounter a few problems along the way. One couple is having marriage problems; the other is made up of a jealous lover and a beautiful blonde who holds the key to the relationship between the other couple. This independent movie has many good elements going for it. There are several twists and turns that keep the viewer interested,",1
" A strange, many-layered film with several themes and many characters, the darkness of this film is leavened with humor and some light. It includes a Jewish concentration camp survivor, a convict, a young Irish girl, a policeman, and several other people, all of whom are connected by the recent death of a man. His death may have been a suicide or",1
" This movie was good, but it is not for everyone. It has a lot of nudity and sex in it. The movie starts off a little slow with a lot of repetition. But if you can get through the first 30 minutes it gets better. I recommend watching it. ",1
 It's not often the cast for a movie is so well chosen that the viewer feels he's in the presence of these people. But that's the case with this movie about a troubled couple desperately seeking a surrogate mother for their first child. The doctor who has agreed to rent himself out as a sperm donor is a little too successful for his own good. The highly intelligent sperm,1
" A group of uniformed police officers are called to investigate the murder of a woman in a house. The victim has been shot by her husband. The investigation, alongside the man's revelation that he believed his wife was having an affair, leads to a search of the premises. One by one, the officers enter the apartment, with each one seeing different things within the apartment,",1
" I didn't think that I would like this movie, but it blew me away. I thought it was a-mazing. I don't know why it's not more popular. The direction and cinematography were great. The storyline is cool. I definitely recommend this to anybody. ",1
" An enjoyable, breezy comedy. A headstrong and adventurous woman wants to see the world, and the first man who could get her there was a doctor. When he does, he must take her to three places before she agrees to marry him. He convinces her to go to Paris, the south seas, and lastly, Africa. Their adventures and misadventures",1
" Could be subtitled ""Citizen Cane"" for the Vietnam years. It's a good movie about the kind of disillusionment that's been a part of every war for centuries, and every war dies another death. One of the best this reviewer has seen in the last ten years. ",1
" This is a very oddball film. I didn't know what to expect, but it turned out to be an interesting, twisted little movie. It takes a bit of backtracking to figure out what's going on (the film is told in flashback), but it's never dull and is actually pretty suspenseful. ",1
" This movie's storyline, about a man who, during his life of crime, never once hurt anyone, is well done. Tough guy Harvey Keitel serves as a believable leading man, and the rest of the cast--including Chris Noth, Robert Pastorelli, and Karen Sillas--all contribute greatly to the film. The film's director, Jon Avnet",1
" A very entertaining film. An interesting mix of mystery, comedy and drama. The movie is very well done and well acted. Despite the dark subject, the film is still funny. The characters' quirks, the combination of tension and humor, and the good editing blend together to form a unique, entertaining film. It looks like a Spanish movie (I don't know if it",1
" It took me a long time to find this movie on tape, but I'm glad I did. I've seen all of the Bourne films, and this one is one of the best.



The story starts by introducing us to some of the basics of the Bourne Legacy, and how the technology works. Then it goes back in time to explain how Project",1
" One of the best action movies ever made, this movie reminds me of a mix between the Bourne films and The Rock. It's a shame more people can't enjoy it. It's one of the few movies that everyone can enjoy since there is no bad language, rape, nudity, or anything else that may turn off people watching it. The plot is very original and",1
" I picked this one up on a whim after seeing the extensive casting list, ""exciting"" trailer and interesting plot synopsis. I was not disappointed. While it certainly wasn't high art and didn't have a big budget, I found that it was a very well put together story for it's budget. Jodie Foster, wonderfully played her role which reminded me a bit",1
" This is the best movie I've seen so far in 2002. ""A Mighty Wind"" is the hour-and-a-half musical comedy I've been waiting for all year. It has the wit and deft satire of ""This Is Spinal Tap"", the warmth and camaraderie of ""Best In Show"", and, an impressive soundtrack featuring the great talents of",1
" This is the remake of a classic film. I never saw the original, but I really enjoyed this film. The characters were well developed, and the action was very intense. I don't care much for the main character, but his wife is played by Sandra Bullock. Another very good female character is played by Minnie Driver. As with most action movies, the characters",1
" This look back at one of the greatest bands of all time is an absolute must for Beatles fans. We are reminded of how John, Paul, George and Ringo were simply four talented musicians and friends that had a dream and made it happen. However, they were not without their share of arguments and difficulties during their rise to the top. And there was much more to the",1
" This movie hits the sweet spot for my interest in contemporary film. The cast is amazing: Alan Rickman, Juliette Binoche, Johnny Depp, Helen Mirren, and even Michael Wincott. It's European, but not too much, and in English. It's romantic, but not too mushy, and it's humorous, but not too droll.",1
" PUSHING HANDS is one of those movies that asks for a leap of faith. There are no startling images, no special effects, and the acting is a bit stiff and unnatural. To get the full episode, one has to be willing to accept the slow, deliberate pace, and the long silences that separate the action. One should also accept the dialogue not",1
" This was a very good movie. The message it shows is very important, that you should always try to forgive and forget. I feel that it is a very touching movie, and I could relate to it. I also feel that people that have been through things like this should see this movie, because it can help them gain a better understanding of what it is like to be",1
" Director Clive Donner's 1978 comedy is a rare delight. It is fun, warm, and well played by an experienced cast. Richard Pryor is real good without his usual profanity, and his chemistry with Christopher Reeve works amazingly well. The plot is simple, Reeve is a teacher who is in love with a single mother. His best friend is Pryor who is also",1

" Director Frank Darabont's adaptation of Stephen King's novel, THE GREEN MILE, is a unique film in that it combines the genres of drama, fantasy, and horror. The film is a period piece which takes place in a prison in 1935. Michael Clarke Duncan is Paul Edgecomb, a black man charged with supervising death row at Cold Mountain Penitentiary.",1
" It is a shame that THE STREET is not shown more often. It is one of the best films to come out of Ireland, and one of the best films about urban life ever made. From the opening scenes of raw violence to the crucial moral choices presented by the film, this is a classic tale of good and evil in modern society. The story follows Ais",1
" I'll be honest with you, I had my doubts about this film. There's a lot you can do with this character, and I've seen so many that are not good. This one, however, really got it right. It's funny, and action packed. The plot is intelligent, and the acting is great. The movie takes a few liberties with the character",1
" I enjoyed this film because it was a comedy with a major twist. Before I saw it, I was wondering how they would pull off the whole ""time-travel"" thing. But they pulled it off in great comedic fashion. It was a good comedy. I would recommend this movie to anyone. Watch it with someone you love - just make sure it isn't your mother",1
" The story opens with a man waking up in bed, only to find his wife dead. A man is trying to save her by CPR, but knows he is too late. The man's name is Frank Morrison (Michael Douglas) and the man who is trying to save her is a paramedic named Vince Scarlotti (Ryan O'Neal). Frank thinks (rightfully",1
" The first half of this two-part film is very compelling and artfully done. The second half is not as interesting, and the ending is a letdown (not to mention a spoiler), but the first half is terrific. This was the last film of Brian De Palma's to be shot without the aid of a script, and it shows. It seems to be",1
" This movie is fantastic! I had never read the book, but the movie made me want to read it. I started reading it last night and couldn't put it down. The film is faithful to the book, which was good. I couldn't ask for a better adaptation. It was exciting, suspenseful and very, very very well acted. I especially like the actor",1
" When I saw the title of this movie - Albert Einstein and the Theory of Relativity - I knew the film was going to be a piece of crap. But, no, this movie is not a piece of crap. It is a rather good movie, though it does have some unbelievable aspects. The movie tells the true story of the scientist, Albert Einstein, and his first",1
" Not the feel-good uplifting Karate Kid movie I thought it would be. Rather, some very real issues are confronted that many kids relate too. Like, what's the difference between street fighting and the martial arts? This movie makes some distinguishments. Ted is a very real and empathetic character. There are definite messages here, and a nice mixed-mart",1
" [SPOILERS] I was surprised to hear that this movie got a mixed reaction when it was released. I felt that it was just great. The story of an everyday guy who was asked to do an errand for the Mafia, and then ended up being a marked man, was well done. It was interesting to see just what a complicated problem it was for the",1
" A modest film from a pre-Tarantino Quentin Tarantino, an interesting look at the roots of the Quentin Tarantino style of film-making. ",1
" APPALOOSA is a very handsome, well-put-together western. I had a small problem that might be unique to me, but the movie kind of grinds to an abrupt halt whenever Viggo Mortensen is on screen. I just don't ""get"" this guy at all. He's this very placid, stoic, cool guy who",1
" A lovely, layered, whimsical tale of a woman who finds herself in an unusual part of New York, but is unable to explain why she is there and who is the mystery woman pulling her through it. The characters, the set, the plot are all beautifully constructed. Once I started watching, I couldn't stop. The ending is perfect. Visually it reminds me",1
" The first time I saw this film was over 20 years ago when I was at university. I have been a die hard Trekkie ever since. Yet, I was watching the new ""Star Trek"" The Movie (the one with that annoying cast member from ""Will and Grace""--you know who I mean--the gay guy--he just looks wrong in that uniform,",1
" A sometimes painful film. Some great performances. But I'm not sure what it is about. It's not quite about the Iraq war, but there are intimations and flashbacks to the war in Iraq. It's about a father who was a soldier and has returned home and had been in a mental institution. And it's about a son in college, who has a girlfriend",1
" What a great way to spend a Saturday! The music, the performances, the story - it all came together so well. The use of music to carry the story was innovative and well done. And the cast was superb. I've been to see a few main stream movies this year, with the exception of Spiderman 3, and this is the best of them. A",1
" I saw this film over and over growing up. I never would have read the book had I not been exposed to the musical. And while I enjoy the musical for what it is, I could never take it seriously. My favorite scene is the one when the children first discover Narnia and the wardrobe. It's such a beautiful scene. Maybe my favorite part of the",1
" As you might guess from the title, this is an unusual movie. If you want to see how an (insert minority here) would react if they were passed up for promotion at work based on their gender, this is a good place to start. Well, that and watching your own paychecks for the next three years. I loved the movie; it was quirky, it",1
" I have seen this movie several times since it's release last year. I've avoided it for a while since it's been getting some negative reviews by those whom probably couldn't see the vision of the director. But now, I feel like I can give it a more balanced review. For starters, the whole idea of a near future setting is very intriguing. I don't",1
" I read up on the reviews and saw this movie for the first time last night so this is my first review. I enjoyed it very much. I felt like I was there during the World War I years. The pictures, the music, the sets and the clothes they wore were fantastic! I really liked Max Von Sydow and Robin Wright Penn. The story was great too",1
" What a classic film and and equally classic selection for the Christmas season! I saw this movie for the first time in my early 20's in 1964 on a New York City drive-in screen with about 20 cars in the lot, and a handful of people in each car. I went to see it again with a friend about 10 years later with a crowd gathered in a theatre",1
" This movie was fantastic! I know not everyone has seen it, but I'm hoping many more will. The gist of it is that a man is the only one left in his family, and he finds out that there is another, who is his son. Between the two of them, one is trying to take down a drug ring and the other is trying to stay out",1
" This is a story of an older man who finds his soul and his life work in a place he never expected to be. How he is granted the space to do this work is both amazing and sad to see. The viewer will be moved to tears and laughter. The music is wonderful. It is a marvel to see the different facets of Cuba, especially children. And the",1
" A wonderful film, although the ending left me a little depressed. I was impressed with how the director and cameramen managed to squeeze so many angles into each scene. I learned in the commentary that the house had been designed to facilitate filming, and I can believe it. The light wells in the house and the outside wall angles were designed to be ""events"" of themselves,",1

 I was searching around for a documentary on the 20th anniversary of the Challenger disaster. I had grown up in the DC area and remembered it as a monumental tragedy. I have to say that I was surprised by the lack of commentary about it. Even the launch footage I had never seen before and was surprised at the coverage of it on TV. I was even more surprised to,1
" This is a great movie for a rainy day. I just happened upon it while channel surfing. It looks a lot like Robert Altman's ""Short Cuts"" but it's not, even though it has some of the same themes. The plot is a little silly but it's pretty funny. There are a few too many coincidences but it is well acted with a",1
" Finally! A masterpiece of fantasy that is not ""dark and gritty"" like the last three films from the Tolkien universe. In fact, this movie is very funny! I laughed out loud many times. Maybe some of the humor is lost on those who have not read the books, but a good deal of it could be appreciated by anyone. I really enjoyed the actors and their",1
" I am soooo very sad that I will not be able to see this film in the theatre as it is leaving the art theatres. It has a very important message to impart. And it is done in such a way that it will open the minds, hearts and wallets of all those who see it. We are the Human Race. ",1
" This is one of the saddest films I have ever seen. I loved the story, acting, and the special effects. I will always love this film. But I could not help but feel the sadness of the mother and the baby at the end of the film. I felt like I was about to cry. ",1
" This is a must-see film for everyone, whether they have a dog or not. It is a true story of how a dog helped a human who was suffering from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

 A DOUBLE LIFE has developed a mystique among film fans for two reasons: the plot idea of an actor getting so wrapped up into a role (here Othello) as to pick up the great flaw of that character and put it into his life; and that this is the film that won Ronald Colman the Academy Award (as well as the Golden Globe),1
" I watched this movie many years ago and it still remains my favorite movie. I have seen it probably 20 times. I can never quite decide if it's a comedy, a romance or a drama. It just is.

Kathy Baker as the wife and mother wasn't too bad either. <br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was that the voices of the boys was not fimished. Other than that, superb production. I would give it",1

 I have read the book twice and have both the book and it's audio cd. The book is quite lengthy and the recording is over 12 hours long but it's worth it. O'Connor is one of my favorite authors.

" LOVED THIS MOVIE! It is both funny and emotional. I cried and laughed through the whole movie. It is well acted and wonderfully written. It is wonderful to see how the characters grow and change as they travel together. A MUST SEE if you love horses, love dogs, are heartbroken, or just have love to give. ",1
 I had seen bits and pieces of this movie several times. When the documentary came out I figured it was time to purchase the DVD. I found the documentary to be a real eye opener. The comments of the people who worked with and knew Anton LaVey in the 70's and 80's were interesting but a bit scary. I hadn't realized that children were involved in,1

It's not exactly free, because in order to get three stories for the price of one, you have to watch the movie in its entirety. But it is well worth the time, and the three stories are a terrific bargain. I'll briefly review each story:<br /",1
 I have seen this movie about two or three times and I like it very much. The subjects discussed are very relevant for today's society. The acting is very convincing and believable. This movie shows what a great director can do with a great story and a great cast. I look forward to seeing more work from this director. ,1
" I am not a young man. I saw this movie twice in 1964 when it was first released. A friend and I were part of an audience that laughed until it hurt. There was a good reason for the laughter. The young actors were not as good as the great masters (Minghella, Capra, et al.) but they were adequate. The movie isn",1
" A classic film, a film I grew up watching whenever I could. Kirk Douglas is perfect in his role, the film is beautifully shot, and the story is timeless. I was able to transfer this classic to dvd and provide a copy to my parents and a copy to our local library so that others may enjoy it as much as I have.<br /><br />",1
 The film is a very good one. It is almost like a documentary. The film left me interested in the subject of neuroplasticity - that the brain is so flexible.

 The book is better than the film. The book truly has more feeling in it. It is fast paced and a real page turner. It is almost impossible to put down! ,1
" Another minor work from Ingmar Bergman. The film is visually pleasant, with very good photography and very nice music. The story is about love, and the eight stages of grief. The eight stages of grief refer to the well-known emotions we go through when a loved one dies. In the film each stage is a different dream from a different character and the seamless switching",1

 I love the thought of an individual being so called the best. It's a secret vice that only true cinephiles can appreciate.

 Hilarious! The humor is great and it gets better and better with each viewing. The film is quite clever and the main character is quite funny. The only thing is that it gets a bit repetitive in the end. I don't understand why people watch this and say it's boring. I don't know. It just isn't. Don't listen to these critics,1
 This is a pretty well done video. It's entertaining with it's magic and special effects. I think i would have enjoyed this more if i would have read the books and if I had paid more attention to the series when I was younger. I give it thumbs up! ,1
" i loved the movie. i thought the plot was great but the animation was a little weird. the 3d animation was very life like while the 2d animation seemed a bit off. i think they need to play out a liitle bit more.

i love to watch this movie again and again.

i give it a 9 out of 10. REVIEW",1
" This is the first of the 5 ""Dune"" movies. I've always liked this one because it is the most faithful to the novel and the least 'Hollywood' of them all. It's nice to see that the series, by the 4th movie, was turning into a Hollywood cash-grab. The first Dune movie was the only one that stayed true",1
 Denzel is a genius. This film is a brilliant showcase of his amazing talent and should be seen by all. Definitely one of the best things to come out of the US in a long time. ,1
" This movie is fun to watch and has very good actors, but it doesn't have that much to offer for repeat viewings. It's a pretty good film, but there are better. I like the idea and the visuals, but the music is pretty repetitive and not all that interesting. ",1
" I like anime, the character designs and the stories are usually great, but I just don't have the stomach for all the blood and guts. Too much like ""Fist of the North Star"" for me. I have to admit that this movie has some great animation and the story seems good, but I don't watch anime for the violence. ",1
" The best movie ever. PERIOD. I didn't see it in the theatre but I saw it on DVD and watched it 3 times in a row, and that's not a joke. I love the action, the acting, the plot, the meaning of the movie, the characters...it's all perfect. I wish they'd make a sequel, and I hope",1
 I like it... really... it's the first movie that ever had a personal message to me... I was 18 at the time... ,1
" The ""Big Lebowski"" is so far my favorite of the Coen Brothers' movies. Though ""Fargo"" was good, it was also a bit more ""realistic"" and perhaps funnier as a result. The characters in ""The Big Lebowski"" are just ""out there"" in a way that makes them particularly funny. Jeff Bridges and John",1
" A masterpiece! A film of great direction and animated artistry. The story is great, the music is unforgettable and the animation is beautiful. The story puts you right into the middle of all the action. I love this movie. ",1
" I was afraid I'd get spoiled because the books are in hardcover, but my fears were unfounded. I liked the movie. I find it hard to believe that first-time director Chris Columbus uncorked this masterpiece. I respect him so much more for it. He has done a great job of entertaining heaven and earth with this one. I was shocked to find that",1
 The Academy should have given this one the Oscar back in days when this movie was made. It's a very good movie with a great story line and a very powerful message. It doesn't matter how it was made-the message comes through loud and clear. ,1
 A true demonstration of brilliance in terms of character development and story boarding. An inspiring movie that should be watched by everyone. ,1
" This is one of those films that is intelligent, witty, not overly sentimental, and life affirming. I noticed that in his review of ""Wit"", Steve Murray referred to the ""general lack of humanity"" in the film. This comes as no surprise considering he is the only reviewer who doesn't like ""Punch Drunk Love"". Murray's review of ""Punch",1
" Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the all time best actors! <br /><br /> I've seen him in a few things now, and he just amazes me. He is one of the few actors who gives me chills in his performance. <br /><br /> The battle scenes were the best I have seen on film! The way they were filmed",1
" Definitely not for those who avoid 'jerky' style animation like the plague, or those who like to see a tight plot or character development.<br /><br />Those who like more bizarre animation, and prefer to see an artist 'interpretation' of a movie, will probably appreciate this movie. The design of the creatures is quite similar to Giger's designs created",1
" This piece of shit was going to waste in the video store, so I gave it a go. 4 minutes in and I was laughing my ass off. The acting is horrible, the plot is silly, the violence is extreme and the lines are as camp as it gets. It's a film from the early 80's about an asylum of the criminally insane who ends up not",1
" This is one of those movies that I am glad I saw, but not really glad I spent money to see. While the scenes of people dying in the film are very realistic, the use of women's bodies as props to sell the movie is disturbing. I am disgusted that the studios decided to try to sell this movie by showing a woman's body, half naked, in",1
" I usually love animated films. This one is weird, but not in a good way. The film is borderline disturbing -- in fact, it's hard to tell where the bad ends and the good begins. The animation is very good as long as they don't use the human parts. If you like disturbing animated films, maybe you'll like this one. I found it too",1
" a good movie for my taste, but i wouldn'y say it's the best of the year. the story is not so interesting, it's just a love story, but i have to say that the cast is really good, and the acting is very good. i like a lot the way the old couple is very cool, especially the wife who was a very good",1
" First, the movie is great, but I never read the books it's based on, so I won't comment on the accuracy of the story. It's a great tale, and I enjoyed it a lot.<br />Second: The blu-ray transfer is crap. I've seen better-looking DVDs. It's just so dark, it's unwatchable.<",1
" I'll warn you up front: Don't read this if you lack a sense of humor. The action is good, the story is interesting, but the real reason to see this movie is the comedy. I love this movie. It is one of my favorites. I first saw it at a friend's house, and have been laughing at it for years. I have it",1
" As a fan of exploitation movies, I thought this collection was a bit of a disappointment. While it is interesting to see what was cut from these films in the past to avoid an X rating, it's a shame they couldn't be left to stand as they were made. The films are still great, but I think the explanations and alternate endings detract from them. Still,",1
" The real drama of this movie is how it captured and defined the spirit of the seventies teenage rebellion... I came of age right around that time and I remember the feeling of ""dissatisfaction"". The story of Pink's search for her identity was very familiar to me and really hit home. This movie had a great soundtrack, the acting was superb, and the ending",1
" I've seen this film so many times now I'm going to have to approach it with some kind of objectivity. Of course, I see it as the greatest movie EVER created. In terms of structure, dialogue, comedy, drama etc it's all perfectly executed. The thing that impresses me most about it is the casting. It is one of the best casts ever",1
" It was fun, it was interesting, it was clever, it was exciting and it was awesome!<br /><br />Six things that make a movie great!<br /><br />The story was really strong and the action was great. It was exciting and had a good level of excitement. It was clever and had some great twists. The script was great",1
" I have had this DVD for about a year and never got around to watching it till recently. I had seen most of the movies in this set in my youth and remember them fondly, so I was looking forward to seeing them again. I was disappointed. Rather than having the crisp, clean picture of past TV / VHS versions, it has the grainy look of",1
" Not a bad movie... But, I am a HUGE fan of all the actors in this movie... I think the main reason for me wanting to see this movie was to see Eric Roberts do a movie with his sister, Julia Roberts... But, I didn't see much of him in the movie to begin with... Although I love Julia Roberts, I do not really think that",1
" All I can say is 'wow' -- this is a movie that I couldn't watch in one sitting. It was just that intense for me. I had to pace myself in order to really get the most out of it. It's one of those movies that if you have enough time, you should just sit through it once -- then watch it again and again, just",1
" The characters are all compelling and well-developed. There are excellent performances by the entire cast including Peter Sarsgaard as Lou Ford, Jessica Alba as his wife, and Elias Koteas as Sheriff Stark. All is swell in this movie, until the ending... which surprises me as much as it will you. I can see that the ambiguous resolution was meant to be",1
" This movie is great, and the characters are so well done I even like the two sisters that are a little annoying. I just have the movie and I could watch it over and over again. The story line is well written and acted. The animation is done so well that you can't tell it's animated. The fight scenes are really well done. They are not just",1
" ""I think this is a horrible time to be a director. All the studios are consolidating, which means you're fighting to get your little niche project made. There's no more 'let's get a challenge on our agenda', like George Lucas' THX-1138. The whole system has gone downhill from there, and it shows. It's all more contro",1
" I'm not sure if I've ever been so ready to give up on a movie and then been so glad that I didn't. If I'm totally honest, the first half of this movie was pretty bad - the romance was uninteresting, the dialogue was clunky, the acting was awkward for the most part. That's why I almost walked out. Even the direction",1
" As it is, I've seen the first two films in this series, and I've been very impressed by them. They're not exactly the most original genre movies ever, but both of them do some really fun things with the genre conventions, and they do them with great style and panache. <br /><br />They're also both of them very funny.",1
" It's not often that a film review provides a life lesson to the reader. And, ""you learn something new every day"". Indeed, I did. Thanks to the film ""The Tragedy Of A Ridiculed Man"" I learned that there is nothing surprising about the fact that people of a certain ethnic group judge others of their own kind by a different standard than",1
" This movie is one I noticed on the shelves of a local video store for some time before I finally bought it.<br /><br />I have had mixed reviews of Mel Gibson's work in the past with critics. I have come to the realization that critics, and sometimes audiences, are looking for a certain type of movie. If they get a movie that doesn't match",1
" In the opening scenes of this film, we see the lives of the central characters unfold in a non-linear fashion, with the narrative gradually choreographed into chronological order. Intercutting past and present events, the film offers a unique visual experience, in which the very composition of the frame itself becomes an integral part of the storytelling itself.<br /><br />This is a",1
 The Tuggerah Lakes region of NSW is a very popular holiday destination. The Tuggerah Lakes Region is home one of the world's most popular holiday destinations - the Gold Coast. The region boasts a variety of attractions and a range of accommodation options to suit all budgets. Your holiday will be filled with fun and enjoyment and you will want to return again and again,1
" From the start of the film we can suppose that watching it will not be an easy matter. By this I mean that it might not be a pleasurable experience, as is the case with some other films about ""abject cinema"" which are not immediately enjoyable. However, it is a difficult and demanding movie, which is full of ""pleasure"" in a different way",1
" Taken director Pierre Morel, that awesome little machine gun that only really gets any exercise in the Taken movies has been put to good use in Taken 2. The first Taken was one of those rare action movies where the action was not only slick and efficient, the plot was actually very very good and it was no surprise that it spawned this sequel. The first was an intense movie",1
" A surprisingly good movie, and on my own part I'm very glad that I have no fear of subtitles. A US remake is already in the works, but I hope they don't change a thing about the script. Great attention to detail, and very little to nitpick.<br /><br />I'm not a James Bond fan, but I enjoyed this movie without",1
" The Hurt Locker, the film that really opened our eyes to what modern warfare is like from the perspective of the soldier on the ground, and it turned out to be pretty good. David Ayer's Harsh Times on the other hand, is, essentially a Hollywood version of the same subject, but it is nowhere near as effective, except possibly as a character study.<",1
" I've never been able to warm to this over-praised film even after three viewings. A biopic of eccentric painter Brett Whiteley, it falls into the trap of being a vanity project for the director, who labours over every shot to make sure we realise what an amazing artist Whiteley was (and is; no one's sure where he is these days",1
" In a little over 100 pages, Bruce Robinson's script for Withnail and I promised all the shenanigans and hilarity we now associate with the film that still stands as a modern classic. Bruce Robinson always has been a writer who inspires great actors. (For my money, he is clearly the best screenwriter of his generation). And the entire cast of Withnail and",1
" Hollywood studios have been dabbling with short film fare for the past few years, with mixed results. Without exception, shorts are just that: a film lacking the space to properly develop the themes and characters inherent in its feature films, often coming off as cheap, thrown together efforts that reek of a publicity-seeking exercise for a more important project. Director David Fincher",1
" The truth about the Mahatma is that he was a womanizer, a racist, had no love for the caste system, and actually rather enjoyed the company of people of the lower classes, including women of all types. The movie frames Gandhi as the hero, and it is a good and very well made movie.<br /><br />However, the movie takes a",1
" It's not for everybody, and it may be a bit off-putting for viewers who find it hard to identify with characters that are at times both infuriating and depressing. However, it's still a good movie with an excellent tour de force from Daniel Day-Lewis.<br /><br />As mentioned in the title, Hawkeye is the protagonist; his name",1
" The movie has been called the greatest anti-war film in existence. ""The Fog of War"" is an Academy Award-nominated documentary directed by Errol Morris. This is an excellent documentary film about a controversial man in United States history; Robert McNamara, who served as the Secretary of Defense from 1961-68 under President Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. The film delves",1
" Off-beat and disturbing, but nonetheless mesmerising, The Lives of Others is a disturbing and at times uncomfortable movie. This is a movie that will leave you wondering what you should think of a person who would do the things that the Stasi men do. If you think you have ever had your civil liberties violated, then spare yourself this movie. You're going to be",1
" The Bourne Supremacy is the best action movie of the year, and is probably the best of all the Bourne films, (Taken 2 being a distant third). With the shaky cam this film is shot on the action really makes you feel as if you are right there in the middle of the action, (this is a great effect). The story is great",1
" The first is that of a young man (Ralph Fiennes) who, in order to escape his family, heads to Argentina to kill Che Guevara, and ends up finding himself. The second, more interesting sub-plot features a married couple (Michael Caine and Marthe Keller) who, having lost their dog at a local racetrack, embark",1
 My wife and I watched this on DVD. There is a reason it was not a popular movie. It doesn't show any cuddliness or kindness to the pet owners. It's a little more real. One of the men just seemed to understand that his dog was hungry and dead and he was not going to get it back and he turned around and moved on. There,1
" Kennedy-Miller could hardly have done a better job at tackling a very challenging exercise: making dry political events work as human drama, and providing an even-handed representation of explosively controversial subject matter.<br /><br />The key to its success on the first count is brilliant acting, although I was less impressed by Max Phipps' performance as Gough Whitlam",1
