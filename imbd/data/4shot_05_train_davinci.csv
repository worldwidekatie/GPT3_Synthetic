0," If you walk out of this film feeling good-and feeling good because you feel good about life-then you have just seen a good film. Yes, ""Primer"" is that good. It encourages the viewer to unravel the film's mystery, to solve the puzzle. It's a film that makes you think. To be honest, I was not a fan of """,1
1," I'm not sure how many times I've seen this video, and my only regret is that someone didn't record the sound from the screening. It's a pity, because the set-list for this show was fantastic (I was there).<br /><br />But what's really going on here? Well, we know that the band is on top of their",1
2," In a film like this, you expect a bunch of silly things that you will not believe, but what you get is a movie that is over the top, but makes sense. There is not a single moment in the whole movie that I felt was not completely logical. Yes, there are a lot of surprises for the audience, but after the first one, the movie was",1
3," 'Chinatown' is one of those great films you don't need to be told about. It's a film so good it's become a part of the zeitgeist, and even if you've never seen it it's a title you're sure to recognize, one of those films you can name just by hearing the first few notes of the iconic score.<br",1
4," Well, I'd have to say that the most important and lasting impression 'America Undercover: The Most Dangerous Job' left me with was a sense of the unqie power of the truth - which is more than I can say for most documentaries. My thanks to all those who participated, and to the makers of 'America Undercover,' for making this movie happen.",1
5, This is a great movie. I love the music and the story. This movie somehow takes you back to the 50's. I remember that time when I was a young girl playing with my dolls. This movie is a must see. ,1
6," When I first saw this film, I thought ""What is this? I don't understand. This is NOT a comedy!"" However, after watching it a second and third time it slowly sunk in that this film is about what is not said. The characters don't speak because they don't have the words to convey their feelings. They look at each other. They look outside",1
7," I, like so many others, had to wait for the dvd to watch this movie. I saw it in the cinema on its opening weekend. I was in my twenties and thought it was great (I still do) but some of my gang went to the cinema and 2 days later were found in the river, seriously affected. <br /><br />I am",1
8," I saw this movie when it first came out in 1959, and have seen it several times since then. I do not remember who said this, but it is certainly true: <br /><br />A comedy is a movie that will make you laugh no matter how many times you see it. A satire is a movie that will make you laugh no matter how many times",1
9," I'm a big fan of the movie ""The Shining"" and the book it's based on ""The Shining"". This book was pretty much a re-write of the book, with a few new scenes thrown in. It was entertaining, but I don't know why they even bothered. I think ""The Shining"" has been done so many times already and it's so",1
10," I saw this film on the big screen, and it continued to haunt me, so I went to the video store and checked it out. Now, I'm a little embarrassed by the fact that I read about this film in Vanity Fair; but the reason that this film is so important, and so engrained in my psyche, is that it is the first film that I",1
11," I was really excited upon watching this film, as I love both the Coen brothers and George Clooney. However, the film was a little dissapointing. I may have to admit that it was partly my fault as I was expecting something more like Burn After Reading, rather than what it was. It's another in a series of their films where the plot is",1
12," There have been a lot of movies about geniuses; little or no movies about geniuses with a sense of humor. This is one of two: (the other is ""Dangerous Minds""). There are a lot of family dysfunction in both movies, and the genius characters are smarter and funnier than their relatives, but it does not diminish the importance of family bonds",1
13," I was so in love with this movie I went and bought the soundtrack and read the book. This is a wonderful book and very well written by Billie Letts. I don't think anyone can tell the story of a small town and family like she can. Cibola is such a great book, I can see why later on in the year 2005 she is going",1
14," This is the Marilyn Monroe movie that, along with 'Some Like It Hot,' is cracking me up the most - so hilarious.<br /><br />I watch both movies over and over again, but I love this one because there is no doubt she was the best thing in it - even though it was Jack Lemmon's movie. WATCH: I'm a big fan",1
15," Casablanca is a story of love, lies, betrayal, and loyalty. One of the best productions of all time, it uses the old black and white and still manages to capture the viewer's attention and create a setting where passionate love and hate are intertwined in such a way as to be hard to define. This story of two lovers, of one woman and two men",1
16," I'm surprised at the negative reviews of this movie. I think it's terrific. Sure, it's not for everyone. But it's a great combination of comedy, drama and science-fiction. You can't pull that off without a great script, a good director and a talented cast. I think all of these elements are in place. No, I don't agree",1
17," This is one of the more light-hearted films from the Coen Brothers. It's certainly not something like Miller's Crossing or No Country for Old Men, but more of a light comedy. It's a lot like Fargo in that it's set in a similar genre and it's brilliantly written. I wouldn't classify this as their best film, but it's definitely up",1
18, Worst of the series but still quite enjoyable in its own right. I just love the way that Hammer just kept on going with the series long after the point where the studio was really able to maintain its former levels of quality.<br /><br />In particular the cardboard sets and costumes are a far cry from the wonderful sets and costumes of the earlier films. However I still,1
19," I just got to watch 'The Deer Hunter' for the first time. I'm, frankly, shocked at the widespread, and relatively commonplace, uneducated opinions on this movie. I am shocked that they exist at all. <br /><br />Easily one of the best movies ever made, and I mean ever. It's a movie that hits you in",1
20," I was so excited to see this movie when it came out. I thought it was going to be great and it did not disappoint. I've seen it several times. I love the cast, especially Christina Ricci. She was great in this movie. I think she pulled the character of Sibyl off really well. and Samuel L. Jackson was great too. I",1
21," This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I have seen it way more than 30 times. I love how it really brings you into the movie. It's a little slow at the beginning but that just helps the suspense build. It's not a movie for kids. It contains adult language, nudity and violence but it has a good story line. ",1
22," I have read the book, and the movie is almost exactly the same. However, the movie makes all the characters seem so much less stupid. I mean, in the book, Jody almost gets hit by the semi twice. In the movie, he almost gets hit, but he does this little thing and he dodges the semi. And he isn't so dumb.",1
23, This movie is about these two guys and they're both brothers and if you got a problem with that then I suggest maybe you should watch something else then. Anyways these two brothers are in prison and the oldest brother is in for killing this guy that was keeping his little brother prisoner. So his little brother ends up getting in the same prison and that's where our story begins,1
24, I first saw this movie when I was about 3 years old. I remember thinking at the time that it was so scary that I had to go to the bathroom. Today I would agree with it. I made my friend watch it with me and she wouldn't watch the whole thing. One scene in particular is very scary. I love it because it is a true story and,1
25," This is a great movie. It is a beautiful story about a man who goes to Hell to try to save his nephew and he must get out of Hell. He is sent to Hell by the Devil's son, who is always running around coming up with jokes. A very funny movie... Definitely worth seeing. ",1
26," Silly but still fun! What more could you ask for? Aside from watching Pauly Shore be... well, Pauly Shore, of course. This was just a fun movie to watch the other night, and I don't think it will be one I forget soon.<br /><br />Although I'm not a big fan of Pauly Shore, I still think",1
27," I really liked this movie. It wasn't boring and had good action and even had some funny parts. I like the story, the acting and the action and will watch it over and over again. It wasn't a slow movie I thought it would be. Some movies that are slow and boring you can't wait for it to end but not this movie. You just have",1
28," This is a really cute movie, but I wouldn't advise it for the younger ones. It's one of those funny, feel-good movies that everyone needs to watch once in a while. ",1
29," I would give the movie 9.9 out of 10. It is really good! If you like drama, action, romance, mystery, and a little bit of comedy, you'll love this movie. You'll love the fact that Bruce Willis plays himself. He does a really good job as himself. The movie is really good because it twists you all around and you never",1
30," I watched this movie and I am still wondering why Matthew Modine ever does movies. He's always so stiff and lifeless. I don't think he's American, I think he is supposed to be American. I did like Amy Acker in the movie however. The writing was not great, the story was crazy. I really didn't like anything about this movie except for",1
31," This isn't the first time I've seen this movie, but it's the first time I've reviewed it. First off, I like both of these actors. I think they have great chemistry. The lead actresses is usually a couple of cuts above in the acting department. There's also a freshness to this movie that I like. It's also nice to see a",1
32," I saw this movie in the theatre; I didn't know what to expect because I had never heard of it. The story was so interesting. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I will be looking for the video soon. It is being released February 6th, so I will be sure to get it.

",1
33," I'm a big fan of the LA Noire, but I just wish that all the games I played have this kind of graphics. I don't know, maybe I'm just ""old school"" gamer. But these kinds of games just made me feel unique, but again, just wish that they made a ""laser disc"" version of this game. ",1
34," This movie was absolutely amazing to me. I had never heard of it or seen it before and I loved it. It was so original, entertaining, funny, heartwarming, and sad all at the same time, all the time. This movie managed to make me cry and laugh at the most random parts. I absolutely love it and would watch it again and again. RE",1
35, I knew going in that this movie was supposed to be a bit of a horror movie and yes parts of it were quite disturbing.<br /><br />I didn't think that it was too bad. The movie had some really good twists and kept you guessing about what would happen next.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the movie.<br />If you go see,1
36," Having seen the theatrical release of this movie before, I was glad to see it on DVD. This is a movie that everyone should see. It reminds us of the spirit of Christmas. This has been my family's favorite movie since it was released. Years ago, I couldn't wait for this movie to come out at Christmas time. I loved it because it was different than",1
37," This was one of the first movies that I've seen that was directed by John Boorman.What I liked about this movie was how it had the feeling that you were up in the sky...very cool,very interesting how they make it seem like the world was going to end...and not only that but has a lot of characters that are excellant...Very cool",1
38," If you like smart, funny, yet 'serious', and more importantly, very well acted & directed films, then I strongly recommend this one. I loved the performances of Tom Wilkinson and Simon McBurney, and the story was compelling and thought-provoking. VERY refreshing to see a film about the sciences that doesn't involve stupid alien or time travel plots and silly '",1
39," Oh god, where do I begin? Warning, this is a book review and has may contain slight spoilers (but not really)..<br /><br />So... One of my good friends loaned me his copy of this book, because he knew I loved the show. He'd already read it, so I had no idea what was going to happen. I",1
40," This movie was shot beautifully. The plot was intriguing and the acting was superb. I don't really have any complaints, with one exception. I thought that the beginning was a little slow. I am told that this scene was necessary, but I really did not want to ""get into"" the movie for about the first 20 minutes. I was a little disappointed at the beginning",1
41," At last, a movie that shows the beauty of feral children. Too often, so-called family films might as well be about the happiness of normal suburban families. So instead of a ball-less aneurysm of a movie like The Taming of the Shrew, we have -- at last -- a film about feral children and the joy they bring. Ok,",1
42, I have seen this movie and even though I kind of knew who the killer was from the beginning I still liked watching it. I would recommend it to other people. It comes on Lifetime movie network quite a lot. And I am thinking since it's close to Halloween they might play it more. So please be on the look out for it if you are interested in watching it,1
43," This is the story of one woman's struggle to survive all odds. At a time when the women's rights movement was just starting, she was forced to put aside her personal feelings in order to survive, both mentally and physically, the horrors of war. This is a story about a woman who was not afraid to stand up for her rights. It is an excellent story,",1
44, This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The actors help the story come alive. This is a modern take on the death of a man who dared to speak out against the world that he lived. It is a tragedy and a story of courage. The movie shows the struggle of a man who was an ordinary man that was not afraid to challenge the powers above,1
45," I saw this movie in the theater and was really disappointed that I didn't get to see it again when it came out on video. I hope that it will be re-released soon. It really is a good movie. I'm not usually a fan of horror movies, but this one was werid and scary. I love the idea of the ""bad guy""",1
46, A decent action flick with a fun storyline and good acting from the likes of Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck. The first half of the film is a little boring but picks up in the second half. Worth a watch for any fan of action or Bruce Willis. ,1
47, I've enjoyed this movie a lot. It is about a young girl who appears to have psychic powers. She has the ability to see ghosts and communicate with them. The movie is also about an unsolved murder that happened years ago. There is a clue to the murders that is hidden in a picture that everyone is searching for. The movie has a great cast and is suspenseful,1
48," Classic, Great, Classic, Great, Classic, Great!<br /><br />I could go on for hours about this film. I was born in the 50's and have this deep love for the era. With that being said, this film portrays the era beautifully. The music is great, the clothing is great and it is just a really fun film to watch",1
49," I saw this movie on Lifetime the other day. It was very inspiring, and uplifting. It is based on the true story of an American family during the time of the great depression. It shows how they would help each other out and even strangers. It was very moving how the neighbors opened their hearts to a young boy who was left homeless when his parents were killed in",1
50," The movie ""Rabbit Proof Fence"", directed by Phillip Noyce and produced by Sue Milliken and Sue Maslin, is a movie based on true events. In 1931 in Australia, the white population passed a law that forced half a million Aborigines to be taken away from their culture. This was done because the white population thought that the Aborigines were",1
51, I was going to see this in a movie theater when it came out but I was not thrilled with the previews and it was not really recommended by any of my friends so I didn`t go. I finally saw it on video and I loved it. I really don`t care what anyone says about this movie. I think it is great. I liked Harrison Ford in,1
52," A well-made film that gives a good account of an unusual episode in the turbulent history of the border(s) between North and South Korea. Set in 1952, during the Korean War, this is a bleak film that tells a bleak story, even though the plot is filled with emotional and political complexities. It is unusual because it is not directed at young audiences, but",1
53," What a shocker, this was one of the greatest books I have ever read. It was so different I was shocked when I picked it up. I love to read and love books but this one was different. I love books like The Exorcist, The Omen, and The Stand. But this one was different. I like books that are like movies but this",1
54," Everything I've read about this movie says it's great and I can't wait to see it. It was filmed in Australia, so I so want to see how well they did the New York accent. I am a big Jodie Foster fan, I've liked her since she did Taxi Driver when she was just a kid. I've also never seen Russell Crowe",1
55," Although this is a several years old movie, I watched it for the first time today. It was on TV and I was bored (as I am often). It's about a serial killer and it's a very interesting movie. It's also a very touching movie. I recommend it to anyone who is into horror movies and crime/mystery movies. The killer is very",1
56," I'm really surprised by some of the negative reviews of this film. I thought it was very good. I've seen most of the other films of Aki Kaurismaki, but I don't think this one is as good as Leningrad Cowboys Go America and Juha but it is still good. I liked the characters in this film. I thought the action very",1
57, It is hard to get a good grasp of what this movie is about. But it is a good movie. I recommend it. TARNATION.2000.TVRip.XviD-DVDRip.CD1.avi http://www.megaupload.com/?d=QUBFG1OJ TARNATION.2000.,1
58," This was pretty much what I expected it to be, but still a fun movie to watch. Good effects, good acting, and just enough humor. A good family movie with lots of action. Good movie to rent once you are done watching all the other first run movies. ",1
59," I saw this movie and thought it was great. I have not found one thing to criticize about it. All the characters were spot on and they were played by fine actors. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson were perfect. I am not a particular fan of either of them, but in this movie they were the most believable screen characters that I can think of",1
60," The film is very well done and the plot is pretty straight forward. I liked the acting of the 3 other teens (who were all pretty unknown) as well as the adult cast. The casting of the little boy and girl, and the adult girl, was not as good. Overall I really enjoyed this movie and would watch it again. Lindsey Lohan was great in this",1
61," I am not a gay man so I may not be the best judge of this movie but I found it thoroughly enjoyable. Not educational or thought provoking as it is meant to be funny. A perfect satire of the gay world, mainly the male world. I totally agree the movie should be released to theatres. If it was released to theatres, it would win several awards",1
62," This film is emotionally true, sometimes sexy but always engaging. It has a moral sense, a consciousness about itself, a sense of purpose and a voice. This is not a story told to get there faster. It is a story that needs to be told, it has something to say. It's a story that needs to be told, not just for its own sake but",1
63," In the very first scene of the very first episode of this show, I fell in love with it. The scene where the main characters get their high school diplomas, by knocking the caps off the desks. It was funny. I think I know that moment. Of course, everything was comical to me in high school, being the geek that I was... I did",1
64, I think that the shipwreck 1st class dinner scene is the best scene in the movie. This movie shows us the ending of the Titanic. It shows the boat's last days. It shows everything. It shows the way the life saved people. They were just like rats they were at each other's throats. They were fighting over the last lifesaver. James Cameron did,1
65," Well, what can I say, I'm a big fan of the music of Pink Floyd, I like their music, and I admire the work of Roger Waters (songwriter, composer, guitarist, bassist in the band). I can say that the first time I heard this movie I thought it was a joke. That was after a very long time. I haven't",1
66," A movie that quickly and pleasantly reminds you of a film like Body Heat (1981), this is a slick, sexy and funny comedy from writer/director Christopher Landon. Olivia Munn is cute as a button as Candace, who meets up with ""a-list actor"" Aaron (Justin Long) when he takes her to a secluded mansion for a romantic retreat.",1
67," Little Sister is a decent movie. It is about a guy name Buck who dies from cancer and now he is living in his new house. He is having trouble with the ghost in the house so he calls in some professional help, but before they can get rid of the ghost something weird starts to happen. The movie is mainly scary and about the ghost and the people who help",1
68," I first saw this movie on Lifetime, and totally loved it, and I never saw it again on Lifetime, and wanted to see it again, I then saw it on DVD, and I loved it even more! I have to say, I really liked this movie, I know it's not for everyone, but for me, it was just perfect! I love all the",1
69," The Devil Wears Prada is an excellent movie. It has a good plot, it leaves you on the edge of your seat. One of my favorite movies. I would recommend it to anyone. Some people may think it is stupid, but to me it is the total opposite. ",1
70," First of all, I like the soundtrack. It really carries the movie. And I thought that the soundtrack was a great addition to the movie. The only other movie I have seen with a soundtrack this good is Inception. That was an amazing movie that I thought deserved it. I loved it. But with this movie, I didn't enjoy it as much but I enjoyed",1
71," ""The King and I"" is one of the most popular musicals of all time. In 1956, it was a huge box office success. It won 5 academy awards and was the first movie to win awards for best picture, best director, best actor, best actress and best supporting actor. It was also the first musical to be nominated for best picture. Over the years",1
72," It's quite simple: the movie is very entertaining and it's funny. It's not intended to be profound, it's not trying to be anything it's not nor does it try to be anything else, and that is refreshing. The premise of the movie is simple and not particularly original (two women of different temperaments coming together through an unexpected set of circumstances). The",1
73, I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie but it was actually pretty good. There were some really funny parts and it was really dramatic. I like Jennifer Aniston and she is great in the movie. I wish I could have had more of the comedic scenes because they were funny. Maybe if the movie came out during the summer season it would have been more successful.,1
74," Hi, I saw this movie tonight, and I loved it! I personally think this is one of the better movies that I've seen this year. I do have to say that if you are a Christian you probably won't relate to the movie very well some of the scenarios are not exactly what a Christian would condone. However, the movie itself was very well thought out,",1
75," I love this movie! It is gritty and thought provoking. The characters draw you in and you feel like you know them. I have seen this movie several times and don't get tired of it. I love the ending and the music. I was moved by the picket fence scene. It has a classic feel to it. I can watch this movie any time, and",1
76," Please note that the reviews for ""Black Snake Moan"" and ""Inland Empire"" are one and the same. <br /><br />I'm a big fan of David Lynch's films, but I don't get the fuss for his last movie. ""Inland Empire"" is his most boring film to date. The story is not very clear, and the",1
77," Well, this is a movie that you'll either like or hate with no in-between. It's rather like a run-of-the-mill epic fantasy saga where you have the typical princes and princesses, kings and queens, knights and knaves; and some good and evil magic going on. And, there's always the need for something or someone to save",1
78," I like ""The Uninvited"" for the distinct story that it has, (that is, a young woman having a hard time coping with the death of her sister). The movie is not only a tragic story, it is also a horror story because of the ghost that haunts the house. Both story and horror are fused together to give this movie its interesting uniqueness,",1
79," I found this movie pretty good. I watched it on cable, it was on an old classic movie channel it used to be called American Movie Classics. There are only a few classic movies that they show on AMC now. It was a good movie, I would recommend it to other people. I doubt that you would find it out in a store though. I don't even",1
80," What a brilliant film! ( I agree with most of the reviews about it) It is one of the best of the best. As far as I'm concerned, this film is the last of the great Westerns. From hereon, it was all downhill, with the exception of 'The Wild Bunch' and 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.' <br",1
81," I have to admit I'd never heard of this movie until recently. I was on a quest for some old gangster flicks to add to my collection, and came across this one and thought it looked interesting. I soon discovered it not only starred Jimmy Cagney but was directed by Michael Curtiz (Casablanca, The Adventures of Robin Hood). I'm not",1
82," I love this movie! I would say it is the greatest movie ever made about the issue of race relations in this country. The acting by Sidney Poitier is incredible, his character is so real it makes you think you know him. The acting by Rod Steiger is great also.<br /><br />The movie explores the issues of a black man trying to live",1
83, One of the best films ever made. A masterpiece in every regard. Ara Gevorgyan ,1
84," It's a shame that this movie is not available on DVD because it's one of my favorite movies and I can't recommend it enough to friends. I have several friends who have seen it who either didn't like it or didn't remember it, so they didn't like it. I can't help but think it's because they've seen it on a small screen.",1
85," Very funny and a little slow. I was able to follow but I don't like watching movies where you have to think. It is a lot of dialogue that was going on. The movie was good, and the actors played their parts very well! The actors are good, and the movie is funny. A lot of the scenes are funny to me. A bit hard to",1
86," The film is called ""The Green Berets,"" but it's not about fighting men in the Green Berets. It's about guys in the regular Army who are glorified into making them into Green Berets. The movie is an absurd patriotism fest, with so-called ""realistic"" scenes of real soldiers, in real ""realistic"" situations, doing real """,1
87," I'm not sure what to say as I have not yet seen the movie. Only an hour to go now. I wanted to put down a review now because I know I will be happy as it seems to be a superb movie. I like jazz, I read the book ""Miles Ahead"" by George Cole (the author also) and I'm a big fan of",1
88," Al Pacino's classic performance is given a gloss with a beautiful restoration. The film is equal parts comedy and drama, and Pacino plays both sides of the coin marvelously. I highly recommend this film. ",1
89," The only thing that's really upsetting about this movie is the fact that most people don't even know it exists. And if they do, they still don't know what to make of it. It's not a horror film, but it's not exactly what you'd expect a Wes Craven film to be either. It's also not so much a horror film as a",1
90," This was a decent enough, but flawed movie. The acting was pretty good and convincing, but the script was not. I found it a bit too predictable from start to finish. I also found it unbelievable that all the bad guys would talk so openly about their plans. The contrived car chase was also a little silly. I'm sure if a car chase was to happen",1
91," When I first viewed this movie, I am not ashamed to say I was somewhat bored. I would start to nod off and then wake up because I was scared I would miss something. This time, I saw the movie with a completely different view. I saw the movie with a view that this was the real western, the way a real cowboy would see it. By the",1
92," I was very surprised at how much I loved this film. I'm not in the least interested in ballet. I had previously seen it on tv but didn't really ""get"" it. I was worried I would be bored silly...but I was ""entranced."" It was beautiful and the music was terrific. I was curious about how much of it was accurate and",1
93," Sure, the plot of 'Citizen Kane' is a great one: a newspaper publisher's life and loves are traced by his friends, enemies, and even himself. Sure the photography and special effects are great. But what's really wonderful is the way the film was made. First of all, the direction is excellent. Orson Welles, the director, was only",1
94," I saw this film for the first time on TV in the late 1960's. I never forgot the scene where the Japanese soldiers are trying to stop the tanks and soldiers from advancing, and they are all killed. The soldiers just stand there and pull the triggers. It was the most graphic scene I had ever seen on TV. I am sure I was too young to understand what",1
95," Dusty Springfield was 29 - a mature woman in pop at a time when most of her peers were teenagers - when she made her second solo album, simply called ""Dusty in Memphis."" The album that it's based on, though, is a lot more complex than that, and is certainly more interesting. In fact, it goes quite well down as one of the great",1
96," I first saw this film in 1978. I was absolutely stunned. I thought it was one of the best films I had ever seen. It was certainly the most chilling depiction of revolting human behavior I had ever seen. 'The Devils' is a film that is only meant to be seen once, because it is so intensely horrifying. The director, Ken Russell, is a",1
97, I was shocked when I first saw this movie because it is really enjoyable. I have seen many more recent movies about the Iraq war and they seem to concentrate most on the politics and political reasons for the war rather than the war itself. The problem with this is that people will only really get to know about the war by seeing it. So if people see the war as a,1

It's scary to see how someone's mood can change from one moment",1

194," This was a well-written and well-acted film, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan were perfect as the leads. Hanks was especially excellent in his portrayal of the charismatic and mischievous title character. The ending of the film (""They got it wrong."") left you wondering just who that was referring to. It was a very clever play on words. I wish it",1

197," This action adventure movie is really fun! Lots of action and a good script. The door slam sequences were a teeny bit far fetched but you have to suspend reality. There were some funny bits like 'Dumb and Dumber', a bit of blood and a few deaths. A little bit gory but that's just the way it is. The story moves along",1
198," I liked the book far better than the movie, but still enjoyed the movie and the cast was great. I must say, I don't really like Kirsten Dunst and I think she was out of place in this movie. ",1
199," This is a really well-crafted film. If you didn't like William Hurt or Tom Berenger in the lead parts, it still has a strong supporting cast and is a good story. The story is about the making of the atomic bomb, The film follows Robert Oppenheimer, a wartime professor of physics at Berkeley who was asked to lead the top-secret Manhattan",1

202," In a word....fabulous. Not since the Bands last major tour in 1976 has any of these masterpieces been performed in their entirety. And 20 years after their last studio session, they are still in fine, rocking form. The DVD is also a must for BAND/DYLAN fans. The documentary portion of the DVD is done by Martin Scorsese",1

204," Cetoyen Kane is a French film of dramatic proportions. It's set partly during German occupation in 1944, and partly in the present, and combines historical footage with the current narrative to illustrate the impact of the war on the present. The Gestapo and Milice are the villains, of course. The Resistance is a heroic force and the French people are pragmatically conservative",1
205," My summer series continues with the first two seasons of my favorite comedy show ever. This show has it all: great writing, great acting, great characters, great guest stars, and great guest stars. The cast of this show is enormous, and includes a young Jon Cryer! For a show with an enormous cast, that means great characters. There are plenty of great characters",1

210," On a positive note, the story is well-told and well-acted, with a good ""suspense"" story line that kept me interested.<br /><br />On the negative side, in the early 80's this was a subject that was ""laughed at"" whenever someone brought it up. Now, people are more cognizant of the missing children problem",1

216," This is a very good film, as the subject matter is one that is rarely seen on screen. The problem, however, is that it is not as good as it should be, as the writers never entirely get over the cliches that litter this film.

She is so good in the role, and she",1
218," A fitting 1st season finale, this is a solid, if technically flawed, series in its own right.

219," OK, let me say right off that this isn't the best film, director or script. However, the performances of Klaus Kinski and especially Maria Schneider are so intense and powerful, that this is a must see for fans of classic cinema. Kinski is a wonderfully wicked scoundrel (you remember his role as the madman in Nosferatu The Vampyre",1

223, This is a very enjoyable film to watch. The characters are very funny and it's a great story. I'm not normally into comedy films but I enjoyed this one. <br /><br />The storyline is a bit weird but the way it is presented and told is very good. The actors are all excellent too. The film is old but still very funny and enjoyable,1
224," Seriously, this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. The only saving grace is the casting of William Holm (who I like very much). The problem with this film is that it is a thinly veiled remake of the 1957 Peter Sellers (who I liked very much) classic, ""I'm All Right Jack"". This time, the working class hero is",1
225," I enjoyed this film very much. It was shot on location in France and Italy and the scenery was beautiful. I was sorry when the movie was over. The story was great and the charachters were very funny and the language was great. I would highly recommend ""French Kiss"" to my friends. It is a chick-flik. ",1
226," This is a really good adaptation of ""The Secret Garden"" and a good film altogether. It's nice to see a movie that's not all about action-action-action, and I enjoyed the romance between Colin and Kate, as well as the friendship between Colin and Mary. Also, the ending (which I can't say anything about because of potential spoilers) is wonderful",1
227," This film is very entertaining to watch and very funny! I didn't expect it to be as good as it was so great !! Personally, I think it's better than the first one because there are more funny bits in this one. I would give it a 9/10. ",1
228," ""The Final Cut"" is the first film by line director Yimou Zhang, the man whose last film ""Hero"" was one of the most original and inventive works of recent cinema. While ""Hero"" was a martial-arts spectacular that doubled as a grand sweeping historical epic, this film is of a much smaller scale, but no less ambitious - a thinking man's",1

230," I was 17 when I first saw this movie. I remember thinking it was a great movie. I watched it a few years later with a different perspective. I realized it was a great movie!

233, Very slow and boring. I wouldn't even call this a movie. I fell asleep more than once. I don't recommend anyone waste their time on this one. It actually felt as if they didn't even pay attention to anything that was going on. Too bad because this film could have been good. ,1
234," This was a new and original story in relation to the Saw series with a lot of unexpected twists and turns. It has a lot of good gore and blood, which are the main elements any Saw fan would want, but it also has a unique story. The most interesting thing about this movie, however, is that many of the flashbacks which serve to explain the past are not",1
235," This is one of my favourite comedies of the 80's. What a cast. There were some really good performances in this movie. Cruise is at his zany best, Jack Nicholson is great as always, and you've got Priscilla. Meg Ryan was a tad wooden as well. I think this is the only movie where Cruise and Nicholson are in the same movie",1
236," This is not only a very funny movie, it is quite intelligent too. It's like the Marx Brothers walk into an L.A. comedy club. These guys have talent and a great sense of humor. It's a one of a kind film that will be enjoyed for years to come. ",1
237, I saw this at the cinema and I have to say I thought it was ok. I didn't think it was as good as all the hype that it generated before it was released. Judi Dench was great in it though. I think it was a bit unrealistic because the characters did not rave about how great the film was that they had just seen as they were walking,1
238," I have never been a great fan of ER. I have always thought it rather unrealistic, and nothing more than a soap.

239, I cant believe how many people didn't like this film. It was pretty childish and superficial and I didn't understand what the point of it was but I still liked it. I think it wasn't meant to be taken seriously. It was a comedy about a couple who get married and have loads of arguments and fall in and out of love. Its very funny. I thought,1
240," I've never seen anyone more completely in tune with their character than Jeff Bridges is with this role. He jumps over the top with absolute faith that the line held by his director will be there to catch him.

292," One of the major reasons why I love historical dramas is their ability to impact on me and my insights into life. This film is an excellent example. It is a well researched movie that really did the research to show a part of the past that was ""overlooked"" in our school history classes. It exposes the fact that many people considered the ""First"" American war",1
293," 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is a prophetic film, and it is chilling to be reminded of how many of the concepts it presents have become reality. I have several versions of this film, and this one is the highest quality. Stanley Kubrick isn't always the easiest filmmaker to follow, but this film is a masterpiece. ",1
294, What a piece of garbage. I'd like to give it no stars out of five but I can't do that. It's an insult to great films and actors. It's hard to decide who was worse - the director or the screenwriter. They should get another job - at Burger King. I'll never watch this again. ,1
295," DRACULA is a true masterpiece of the horror genre. It is a fitting tribute to the author Bram Stoker to adapt his novel to the screen in such a memorable way. The picture is scary, sexy, suspenseful, and has amazing set designs. Bela Lugosi is a perfect Dracula. His performance haunted me as a child and thrilled me as a teenager",1
296, I have watched this movie over and over. It is the story of an American family and their reaction to a riotous time in history. I am always intrigued by the way the movie is made. It is intellectual and a little stilted. But it is also very emotional. The story is about how the character's feelings about what they are going through and the feelings,1
297," ""Sid and Nancy"" is more of a movie about music than about the infamous punk couple. But, it is one of the best rock music movies of all time. It is based on the story of Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious (Gary Oldman) and his American girlfriend Nancy Spungen (Chloe Webb). It is about their relationship, their",1
298," Red River is a Western of epic proportion, an epic that's not just about the settling of the West, but a story about the building of America, and the civilization it produced. As the title and introductory sequence would suggest, there's a bit of a John Ford-flavored epic about it, but it's not just a pale imitation. It's got its own",1
299, I thought the movie was excellent. It kept my attention all the way through. I didn't expect it to be as good as it was...about a man who keeps seeing the same woman in his dreams. I really liked the flashbacks. You will have to watch the movie to find out what really happened. It is worth seeing. ,1
300," I have liked this film since I first saw it and now, being as old as some people on this site, I'm a bit sad that it isn't on DVD. I want my daughters to see this film. I want to see it again. It's such a good, funny movie.(I realized I'd never commented on the film, even though I'd read",1
301," One of my favorite movies of all time. I love every aspect of this film. It mixes romance, drama, comedy, and even some action. It's a sweet story of eternal love and the trials that come with it. There is so much depth to the characters and to the story that you never get tired of watching it. It is timeless and reminds me of many",1
302," What a superb movie! I haven't been able to stop thinking about it for days. I first saw this movie with my parents back in the summer of '84. It was the most exciting thing I had ever seen. Then I went out and bought the soundtrack--boy, I was obsessed. I listened to it over and over again, for weeks. I memorized",1
303," ""The Snow Walker"" is a solid film adaptation of a novel by Charles De Lint (the same guy who wrote ""The Moon Moth""). Like most good films, the film stays as close to the original as possible, which is a good thing since De Lint is a talented writer and has managed to capture the spirit of the story of a young northern Inuit",1
304," This movie is entertaining, in a creepy sort of way. It's not exactly horror, though there is enough blood to make it so. And it is not exactly a comedy or thriller. It's a little of all three, but mostly, it's a deep drama. But a good one. ",1
305," I don't even know where to begin on this movie. First off, I really love the film, so you'll probably hear a lot of praise. I think it's hard to talk about a movie that mean so much to me, that I have probably seen dozens of times (if I had to guess, probably close to 20 times), that I love so much that",1
306," When I first saw this movie, I enjoyed it, but I didn't understand it. I guess I was young and naive, and I just didn't get the point of the movie. I went to see it again a second time, and I understood it better. I understood that the point was to show the bad things that humans do to each other. I understood that",1
307, Another winner from Billy Wilder. ,1
308," A good start to what would become a trilogy firstly in the story and secondly in the technology used to make the film. I remember the first time I saw this film, with my older brother, when it was released. I was 10 years old. This film has always been a favorite, but in terms of special effects, you should have seen what they did in Star",1
309," ""The Bridge On The River Kwai"" is a classic war movie that is now considered to be a classic. The acting of Alec Guinness and William Holden are great. Also, the acting of Jack Hawkins is wonderful. The action and the cinematography are great. This is a classic that everyone should see. ",1
310," There's more to this movie than just some erotic pie throwing. It's got a great performance by Nancy Allen, a pretty sexy performance by Jamie Lee Curtis(who has grown'up'a lot), and a pretty good performance by Ray Liotta. The cast and plot make this a pretty good 'thriller'. I would have given it five stars if it wasn",1
311," This is a pleasure to watch with a good twist and cast,perhaps not the best film of the year but still a great film to watch and enjoy. ",1
312," I just recently saw this movie for the first time. I have to say that I have never seen a better film than this. It's got everything. Not only did it spark my interest in the Civil War, but it also did the same for my interest in Abraham Lincoln. I honestly have never heard about or read anything about him. That's going to change REAL soon",1
313, I know this film from start to finish. It's hilarious. It's an strong link to my past and will change the way I view film in the future. Hypothetically&helli ,1
314," I'm not going to give a plot synopsis here, so I'll just say that this movie will make you wonder about the fine line between sanity and madness... it also will make you wonder if Michael Douglas made a wise choice and how poor a choice it was to get involved with Sharon Stone. I will say that Michael Douglas is good in this film. He plays a guy",1
315," This film is one of the few that I have seen more than once, as I like to see it from time to time. It has a wonderful blend of comedy and drama. DeNiro and Pacino are very well matched and the film does not miss a beat. ",1
316," This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The acting was so good and the characters so well-developed. The only negative thing I could say about this movie is that the ending is a little slow. But the ending really impresses me, because there is never really a set-in-stone answer to the question, ""Who survives?""...which is",1
317," One of the best movies I have seen in my entire life. I have never seen a movie that portrays more than its title. Its depiction of the life of a girl who wants to belong to a group she feels left out of, is so real that I felt I was experiencing everything she was going through in her life. She felt lost, alone, desperate, and suicidal",1
318," Cried? I don't cry. I mean, I do, but only when I'm watching this film. I'm not even sure if this column is supposed to be about Citizen Kane, but I don't care. It is, how I feel, about the greatest film of all time. If you haven't seen it, that's not surprising. It was never",1
319," I can't believe how good this movie is. It's funny, witty, dark and sarcastic, all the while being so beautiful! The script is quick, charming and very very smart. The scenery is amazing. The music is outstanding. It's a perfect movie.",1
320, This is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made. It has a great cast and an original story. The acting is excellent especially by Sigourney Weaver and Tom Skerritt. I'm a die hard Star Wars fan but Aliens is still my favorite movie. It's a great movie to watch for the first time or to watch again after you've seen it a,1
321," I have seen about a thousand films in my time, and this, I believe, is far and away the best. It is a telling example of the best of what Hollywood can be. The story is heartbreaking, heartwarming, and heroic all at the same time. It is a tale of family, love, and overcoming the odds. I have seen this film twice,",1
322," First off, if you're like me and grew up watching the original Godzilla films and the silliness they entailed, then you'll like this movie. I laughed out loud at the references to the original films and some of the campiness of the new film. I also love the way Godzilla's character is developed in this film. As well, the film is paced very",1
323," The best movie I've seen all year. Even better than ""The Aviator"" and ""The Incredibles"". The story is very exciting and is based on true events that happened during WWII. I think the actors were great, they all seemed to fit their roles perfectly. The movie is very well done and it keeps you absorbed throughout its 2 hour and 50 minute running",1
324," A great film on so many levels, especially if you are interested in the history of the American Revolution. Much could be said about the amazing work of the actors, costumes, set, script, direction, etc. I do, however, want to focus on the cinematography. The film succeeds as a piece of visual art and holds up to repeated viewings. There are",1
325," I had never heard of Jack Yufe before seeing this film. It's a very interesting documentary, which one can see on youtube, depicting his journey from a North African Jewish family to his conversion to Christianity. His journey from Morocco to the United States via Cuba, and his becoming a leading member of the Christian community. A very interesting documentary. ",1
326, I hated this movie. It was boring and stupid and didn't make any sense. It made a lot of people mad. I think it was a waste of time making it and paying to see it. I don't know how it got to be the number 1 movie in America. I would like to see the people who like it get a life. When I went to,1
327, What can I say? I know this movie from start to finish. It's hilarious. It's an strong link to my past and will change the way I view film in the future. Hypothetically speaking :) The down-fall? There's no Socrates Johnson! ,1
328," This is perhaps Agnes Varda's most beautiful, magical film. I've seen her ""Cleo from 5 to 7"", and some other of her films, and they are all so beautiful, but this is somehow my favorite, perhaps because I was born in the year of her main subject's birth. Poetic, funny and sad, ""The Gleaners",1
329," First of all, the new cut of this film is a disgrace. I am the biggest fan of this film (even moreso than the original cut). If you liked the new cut, then you didn't see the original cut. The new cut is a complete mess. The director has re-edited the film while at the same time using out-takes from the",1
330," I have just finished watching the movie, I was saddened to see that our beloved Southern Belle's were not portrayed in any positive light whatsoever. I instantly hated Lillian, Daisy and Trixie, and was disgusted with themselves for being so. My heart completely went out to the black characters, I cried when they were hurt and could not believe the cruelty shown by their white",1
331," I'm a massive fan of ""The Office"" and I particularly love David Brent. I knew he'd been in some other stuff, but I hadn't heard of this until it came up in conversation at work. Turns out it's one of his best roles. I've seen the entire thing twice now and I still laugh out loud. It's pretty much a complete spoof",1
332, It was amazing movie although I'm not a fan of action movies. It was pretty funny and I couldn't stop laughing. I think the main action is between Jack Dawson and Rose Dewitt-Bukater. It's a great story of love and it was very well told. I'd like to buy it on DVD as soon as possible and I'm sure it will,1
333," I can only say that I am very dismayed that the UK is going to have to wait until 2003 to see this film. This film is one of the most brilliantly written and performed films I have seen, and I was in awe (and still am) at the sheer brilliance of it. It is a wonderful comment on the chaos of our modern age, and I think",1
334, I grew up watching this film and I love it. It's a good reflection of '60s and hip-hop culture. The Yancey Boys are a symbol of black pride and defiance in the face of oppression. When I became a teenager I began to see the black experience in America as a much more complex one. I first read about Malcolm X and the Nation,1
335," I think this film is important for the sake of everyone who has at some time in their lives, experienced bullying of some sorts. It is a serious problem that has never been addressed in a film. I think this film should be required viewing for High School students. It is a message that everyone needs to hear over and over again. And anyone who has been affected by bullying",1
336," All I can say is that the movie was beautiful to watch and the music and vocals were superb. It was great to hear all the songs from the original cast, and the stars voices, such as Liza Minnelli (though I miss Christine Baranski). The movie had a great story line and was compelling. The singing was amazing. And the ballet was fabulous.",1
337," <b>P.S.</b>Just watched this wonderful film. It's a classic! Also the music is fantastic. Great Mood. Great Scene. It's worth seeing. It's a movie, you don't wanna miss. ",1
338," I love this movie! I am always on the lookout for ""foreign"" films. This one doesn't disappoint. I liked it so much I bought the DVD. It's a good, humorous story told about a boy who just wants to be able to call his mother on her birthday. We follow this boy's childhood through his adult life. We see his struggles with his",1
339," I tracked the trip two years ago on the internet - now I've seen the film!! What a ride! And what a trip to finally get to know Darius Weems! Such a courageous, wise, funny and talented spirit! And what a Crew! To listen to Darius laughing from being in the water at Panama City, to see his trepidation of being too close",1
340," The original ""trucking movie"" is a well-made, above-average entry in the ""drive-in movie"" class, and I still enjoy watching it. It's a great example of the road movies inspired by Easy Rider, and even more of an earnest attempt than that film was to capture the flavor of the times. I love the title song, which",1
341, Susan Hayward was the first star of the American cinema (after James Stewart) to win an Oscar for her performance in a Oscar-winning film.<br /><br />And what a performance!

342," I need to preface this review by stating that I was never a particular fan of the original ""Saw"" movie, but I have to admit that I really enjoyed the sequel, ""Saw II"" in a rather big way. <br /><br />The movie's action was fast and furious and it was really freaky for me, especially when I was",1
343," I'm not going to do the standard ""this one is a better picture than that one, it's definitely a classic, etc."" etc. Watch the movie and decide for yourself or else see this review and save yourself the money and the time. This is a one dimensional movie that tries to cover all the bases in its little 90 minute run time, it doesn't do",1
344," A CURE FOR WELLNESS is a movie that isn't afraid to be seen as bizarre, and to be seen as a tad pretentious at times... And it also has a rather dark, surreal and horrific sense of humor that I've always enjoyed in Guillermo del Toro's films... It's almost like ""Hellraiser or ""The Devil's Backbone",1
345," The best movie, in my opinion, comparing to the James Bond films. Ok, it is not a Bond, but I think it is better because in this one the action begin in the middle of the movie and the rest of it is just building up, action until the end. However, I think it is a little bit silly, this movie, but I love it",1

347," A GREAT FILM.... I remember watching this film when I was first introduced to films in high school. I was blown away. I still watch this film from time to time because it is incredible. The acting is outstanding, and I usually don't like Charlton Heston, but here he does a great job. He plays a man who was the best of the best",1
348," I went to the film with a vague idea of what to expect and was completely blown away by the power and vision of the film. I had heard that the film was 'difficult', 'challenging', 'daring' and 'uncompromising'. I think what all of them are in a sense is true. The film is about as far from a mainstream",1
349," The most misleading title I've seen in a while. A real ""shitstorm"" as it's said in German would be a welcome change from the mediocre ""action"" movies we get these days. And that's what I was looking forward to: a real action-packed thriller that doesn't bore you about the hero's childhood/life and instead is all about the action",1
350," A brilliant satire on the American media and its obsession with sex. Well-made and a lot of fun. It follows a couple of would-be comedians trying to make it in show business in Hollywood. If you're looking for a raunchy comedy, this isn't it. This is a clever, intelligent comedy that will leave you laughing. The first thing you have",1
351," Without thinking about it much, I decided to take the plunge into the world of anime films. There are a few that are incredibly well-known, but others that have, well, less than perfect reputations. I'm happy I picked this one. Purely for the art design, this zooms to the top of my must-see list. It's hard going",1
352," There is so much to enjoy in this film. The casting is pretty good; the story well written, although the ending is a bit rushed and contrived, but on the whole, this film is worth watching.<br /><br />To say what I think of the characters would be to give away too much of the story, hence I am going to hold back",1
353," I like the movie, but the book is much better, and I feel that book deserve a higher rating.<br /><br />I've read the book about one year before watching the movie (unfortunately I haven't read the book after watching the movie). Now I'm reading the book for the second time and I'm shocked how accurate and well written is the book",1
354," The first two hours of writer/director and actor/producer Quentin Tarantino's third feature film are very interesting and provocative.

The first two acts are essentially about two men - one a pimp (the great Ving Rhames) and the other a",1
355," I'm not sure how I feel about this movie, with the exception that I like the acting performances and the scenery. But it's hard to really enjoy a movie where the writer/director/producer (not sure on his titles) is clearly a sick, twisted, creepy person. He's not artistic either, he seems to be trying to be artistic, but just",1
356," I was rather shocked by this movie. I enjoyed it, so it must have something going for it, but at the same time the degree of violence was surprising. It's not as brutal as it could have been, but it's still pretty full on. There's also a lot of the kind of humour that makes me not want to watch a movie again. The kind",1
357," The best thing about ACTION UNLIMITED is that it puts in an appearance in the final installment of the ""Kill Bill"" saga.

359, This movie was quite enjoyable and interesting. It became a little more interesting and suspenseful once the air force began tracking the aliens. Very stylishly shot and produced. The black & white and the lighting really adds to the overall mood. It becomes even more suspenseful once the people start coming out of their houses and the aliens begin killing them. The music was very fitting of,1
0," A major disappointment compared to the first two movies in the series. ""Ghostbusters II"" is like a bad imitation of ""Ghostbusters I."" It was completely unnecessary and just plain stupid.

I mean, you've got lots of opportunities for cool action shots, and the subject matter is pretty juicy; but I guess you just need some sort of shame or at least some talent to make it work. ",0
21," This is a style over substance movie, which is a bummer. The screenplay is very good, and the direction is pretty solid too. But the acting is not the greatest. The story is odd, and that's part of the reasons why it's so popular. But the acting plays just doesn't quite cut it. Perhaps it comes down to seeing a movie like this",0

She did her best work with the first two films, and it is to her credit that she was able to keep the series enjoyable, despite the",0
32," This movie is almost unwatchable. It's slow, the story is lame, and it's just plain stupid. I'm sure it will hold some kind of nostalgic value for some people because it's a classic for them, but I've seen it, and I really don't care to ever see it again. Except when it's on TV (which happened almost a",0
33," I laughed so hard that I cried. It's the first movie I've ever seen that I wanted to see again- the first that I could watch over and over. It's so ridiculous that it's funny. And it's not just the plot, it's the dialogue- the sex scenes, everything. It's like a soap opera. I loved it. It's",0

35," An all time favorite film of mine that goes under the radar. What can I say, I'm a sucker for the kind of film Rififi was, films with a very tight script and stylized direction that are almost directed like plays. Rififi is the cinematic equivalent of a stage play, and I'll always fall for it. And it's not just because",0
36," The original ""Goldfinger"" was a departure from the second Bond film, the campy ""Doctor No"", which by today's standards is quite good. However ""Goldfinger"" took Bond to a new level of sophistication, but it's also a darker Bond film. The film is rich in detail, and the opening sequence is the best of any Bond film. Pierce Bros",0

39," I could not get into this movie. The plot is interesting enough, and the acting is good. But, the story is never really developed, and the lead character is never really fleshed out enough. Maybe it would have been stronger if it were a 4 episode mini-series on TV instead of a 2 hour movie. ",0

42," I like most movies with Jason Statham and don't much care for his 'tough guy' role, but Bullseye more than made up for it. Yes, a classic story of revenge, but with a great twist. Statham's character is a patsy, just a guy that gets stuck in a spot he can't get out of. But he",0
43," The 3 stars is only for the film's technical achievements (the script, the acting, the direction, the cinematography). The story is pretty boring, and the acting is far from great.

44," It's not a very good movie, the camera moves very fast and it makes it hard to follow the story. I would say that it's ok for a person who likes semi-disgusting and more than a little bloody movies, but I think that there are better ones out there. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody who hasn't seen it yet. If you",0

50," This film is like the bad, re-released film that they put out on the PS2, it is exactly like that. I'm not saying that it was the worst movie ever because there are many films that are just so bad and terrible that watching it is just so painful to do. But this movie is just so stupid that it is funny. The acting is horrible",0
51," I have no idea how this film has any kind of positive reviews. It just doesn't make any sense. Yes, it starts with a fascinating idea, but then it just meanders along. It relies too heavily on the performance of one actor, and the rest of the cast is quite weak. The look of the film is quite awful (little girls with cleavage scars",0
52," To call ""Rocketship X-M"" a science fiction classic is due more to its release date (1950), its savvy ability to capitalize on the publicity for ""Destination Moon"", and the appearance of actors who would later star in television as Sea Hunt's Mike Nelson, Rockford's dad and Wyatt Earp.<br /><br />The movie itself is bad",0
53," This movie was pretty bad, it was a waste of my time, right from the first scene I knew it was going to be bad. I knew that it was going to be a bad movie from the very first scenes, and I was correct. I didn't like the movie from the very first time I saw it, it was not something that I would watch again.",0

The scenes in the hospital are especially",0

It was billed as a comedy, but there was nothing funny about it. The storyline was just plain confusing and the jokes were just stupid. What really disappointed me was the fact that they billed it as",0
75, This movie is so bad that the director should be ashamed to have ever made it. The acting is horrid! The cast should be ashamed of themselves for ever making it. It was not even funny in the least. I felt sorry for the actors getting involved in this. I am actually glad it was only a short film. It gave me hope that it would be over,0

128," Had to laugh at this one ... while watching it I kept thinking 'The Wicker Man' meets 'Deep Throat' ... what a combo ... instead of one long scene of the mystery surrounding the kids' disappearance, better to break it up with some sex ... the mother, the cop, and the douchebag at the drop-in center. That would have been",0

130," A short film that was obviously very stagey and it took me out of the movie. The acting was just as bad, but I didn't expect too much from a short film. The main character was a wimp and too much of a goody-goody for me, I know you probably need a character that was innocent and a bit dorky in order",0

137," I was so shocked by the negative reviews of this movie. I think it is very well done.

168," I rented this movie on DVD at a local video store. The movie alone was a typical action movie (cheesey acting, a thin plot and bad computer graphics).
