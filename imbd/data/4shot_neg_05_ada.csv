" I couldn't believe I had seen this and couldn't find a second viewing. Put it up on IMDB, how's that? You should've seen it first hand. It's a total rip-off of the Mitchell Brothers' feature from 1930's time, although the story adds something new to the mix, for starters the killer is a rich man, he has a",0
" ""Rocketship X-M"" is an unmitigated disaster. Aside from some boring action scenes, the movie itself is so good that it should be skipped due to the conclusion being too uninspired to sustain a movie. Very poor MST3K film. MST3K does not deserve all the bad reviews in the industry. They should be ashamed of themselves",0
" This review is a bit long winded so hopefully you don't mind. I got ""Rocketship X-M"" out of a discussion I'd had with a friend. He thought there was too much science fiction in the movie and was absolutely not into the movie, not even the sci-fi sub-genre. The story is pretty much a Big Screen Get Up",0
" I don't know, but the movie, with a little help from Courtney Love can't really be called a great one after all. There really isn't any new ground being broken in this love story, and the only thing that makes it interesting is the voice of the man whose dead wife is played by the MST3K cast members. Ripley, Moore, and",0
" My roms do have a love-hate relationship with this film. They both love it and hate it at the same time. The remake with the same cast (which seemed to have this year's actors and director at the time) is a real page turner for those who didn't realize they had to go through the whole ""worst movie ever"" script and completely miss",0
" I think it's safe to say that every movie fan has one of these images in their mind - a UFO, a Black Knight, certain absurd looking cars, a giant flying saucer, a pre-determined, impossible situation... It would be great if there was one of those films. But there isn't, because we all have too many movies with that kind of",0
" I loved this movie, first and foremost because of the delightful performance by Ginger Rogers as the young and unstable Lyle Talbot. She even played the part with the same clenched fists and frown. It's hard to not like a performance that some say bestows the worst on a movie that has been going on since the first of the century. This movie wasn't a scandal",0
 a niggling problem. I mean this movie has a lot of potential. The only thing I can think of is a storyline involving a steam train system we could have never imagined in real life and a description of a steam railroad of sorts. Could they have also built the first steam train in the world? ,0
" I think the only reason this movie was made is because the SAG Act was passed, allowing any movie to be made by any union.<br /><br />I firmly believe the SAG Act was passed from sheer overweening greed, and all but fifteen unions refused to unionize the flick. Although this defies logic, because why would any skilled producer like to",0
" There is a lot you've heard about the MST3K versions of Star Trek: The Next Generation. For starters, it's totally ridiculous. It's a lot of fun, it's all about Star Trek and not just about Star Trek. But even if the show's not as interesting or entertaining as it should be, it's still a damn good show. And",0
" this movie is quite amusing at times but it's a mess at others - the script is so so bad that it's unable to produce anything worth watching. The whole idea of being fired for writing a story to the wrong desk with someone you obviously just made sure to have by name is a pretty bad idea.

The truth is it's",0
" I remember when this movie was released back in the 90's. NONE. But I still have the issue of the word ""stupid"" getting right up in my face.

" this movie is a complete disaster. the script is bad most of the time leading to a terrible performance by Joel, and the characters are completely uninteresting and forgettable, the plot is so unclear that it often seems as if the director simply didn't bother to write it at all.<br /><br />this movie is a really bad movie that never becomes anything more than",0
" Is it really possible for someone to tell the time to this film from the time it was produced until nigh on fifty years later? It's a very hard question to answer.

In this bleak and dystopian future, humanity and its intelligence can only live",0

After all the movie it's a love story of two young women who are destined for love. Sure the story is pretty straightforward, and the characters match the roles these two roles have, but it just didn't work for",0
" I wrote this review back in 2002. I still haven't come to terms with its utter failure. This movie is full of gimmicks. The title is based on a song that was popular in the 1950's. There is even a double life character appearing in a lego minefield. I don't mind the individual gimmicks, such as the lemming man on",0
" Awesome song ""Driftwood"" by The Bagmen. The movie is a sci-fi nothing more than a raunchy little movie for the studio to rope in their cash cow who is a little too pretty about it and a bit too smart to do it in the first place. Told by director Sidney Gordon, this is a loose adaptation of the nineteenth century's",0
" This film is definitely not enjoyable. In fact, it is just plain irritating. The acting is poor, the music is pointless and the storyline.. well, whatever the plot is, it is boring and plain. The plot is about a guy who comes into possession of a nuclear bomb, which is then taken by a man to a base, where the people there are being blackmail",0
" Its a great film that has some great music, great performances, and interesting characters. Neil Gaiman's The Graveyard Book is really the only similarity to this, but the others are all made up. ",0
" I am a middle aged guy who has been watching MST3K since five when they first started. I used to watch this movie every Saturday night, just to see if we could figure it out, but I never got around to watching it last night. Don't know why, but I can only pick up that the movie is still a good one. I don't",0
" This movie has some very nice music and really well-done performances, but the plot isn't bad at all, except if you feel the need to make a joke about being in a Japanese nuclear plant or something, and this movie is kind of dull, boring, stupid. But it has some nice moments. ",0
" If you're looking for a film that doesn't make you feel emotionally upset, that doesn't make you want to kill yourself, that doesn't make you want to go out and buy a bottle of wine, that won't make you cry, that won't make you wonder what you are going to do next, that's not this movie; if you're looking for a",0
" The most interesting drawing in a long-term relationship is the relationship between the two individuals. I mean, it would be stupid to never have sex, and not commit to more than one person at a time. I mean if you know that you're going to get pregnant, what difference is the marriage? Its like marriage is like trying to get a loan without an ATM machine",0
" ""Great White Shark"" is a flick that raises the bar for all sci fi, and does it brilliantly. It's a movie that will have you smiling from ear to ear as long as you have the patience to wait for the end credits and the lame nature of the movie to display itself. The actors deliver incredibly well, and the impossible, animated scenes are all excellent.",0
" I remember one of my first film classes back when I was an altar boy here in Miami. One of the teachers was named Daniel. Not a big fan of films, he was always rather critical of any film he thought might be a mistake. Every film he ever saw, he had a question that he was going to ask the director. Every student got to ask him a",0

My best friend and I rented it a Thursday night, and we watched it during a couple of vacation days, and left to the little North Florida beaches the next morning. Well, he watched it the night before and it started to get boring. It wasn't too",0
" This movie is an absolute bummer. Every time I put the DVD into the player I feel a sense of queasiness. The music is different, in a good way, the dialog is interesting, and the movie is entertaining but boring. But I guess it has to be like that. It's like the flick doesn't really need to be so bad, just not",0
" There is something about this film, some aura of mystery and lore, that makes it one of the better sci-fi films of the decade. I mean, who else could pull off the damn whistle-blower, and move the bad guys from one crazy smuggling scheme to another? Still, even with the good and bad performances, it's kind of silly and suffers from",0
" Imagine this: you go to another planet and your spaceship is stolen, and you have a friend request a kiss from him. This is not a movie you have to watch carefully to figure out what happens next. This movie makes you laugh. ",0
" I can even think of a few good things about this film. There are some good songs in it. It has some great performances and interesting stories. Kudos to the producer for getting the picture done, and has most of the cast (with the exception of Michael Jackson) know how to read music and have good singing voices. The sound production is very clean and crisp.",0

" I've always loved MST productions since watching them as a kid, and this one is a definite classic. I wouldn't mind revisiting it again, although the crowd scenes have been gone through several times. The good music and performances go well with this, but I am surprised and disappointed in the movie as a whole. It's a very well-directed, somewhat interesting",0
" A vacationing couple sets out to find a cavern lake in the American West to build a nuclear bomb. Unfortunately the lake is dry, so they have to paddle across a frozen river to explore the unexplored caverns, only to find it to be a giant Shangri-La. The picturesque riverside scenery is great and all, but the script makes a mockery of",0
" This is a rather simple story, without the time or space to explore it in depth. It doesn't say much, and its strength is in its portrayal of the real life events; it shows them realistically, and for that reason it can appeal to many viewers. I have seen this film many times, and I always look forward to seeing the next movie because of the fantastic",0
" This was enough to make me laugh especially when it came to the actual plot, but its an average hit for the most part. The story, while engaging enough, is really bad and there's not that much plot. The most eye-opening moment for me was when the aliens abduct the boys from the spaceship, and you realize that they're abducting kids too- this",0
" I am often scathing in regards to how MST3K series has become one of the worst in the history of television. I've seen the shows accept this NUCLEAR bomb the same way they accepted the ""Metalhead"" and ""THOR"" trash. I think they are in a class by themselves, but they are not only a good program, they are",0
" while this movie was a bit of an oddity in that it was a science fiction movie, it also was not conventionally a sci fi movie. It has a very special kind of sci fi that is not found in the mainstream film. This movie was focused on a girl played by Clara Bryant that travelled in a spaceship to a planet with a secret technology that could bring humans",0
" I absolutely luv this movie and luv the actors that played the roles of Scarlett, Br'er Watson and the narrator. I think the story was interesting and it was very interesting to see the story and I liked the way the director made it and the story good enough to put a movie on it's own. I didn't like the way the movie ended. I",0
" The reason this film feels like it's on the cutting edge is because there is no story to the story, and there is no story to the story. But I do feel it's a bit insipiring.

 What a simple way to make out a film. I saw this on Cd 2 and I thought it was pretty good. I liked the simple and obvious home-made-off-the-shelf-scenery of the planet Mars. I thought it was nice that the movie featured some of the most famous space scenes of all time too. The best was when the,0
" I'll admit that I was dubious to see this film in the theaters. It looked like a science fiction film with boats and alien ships, and I wasn't actually expecting a science fiction film at all. I was more expecting something more like a movie that I'd seen in a video store or something. However I was pleasantly surprised when I went in to see this. I",0
 to sum it up i thought the movie was bad but i thought that they wanted too much fan-service so they forced the viewer into a world they didn't want to be a part of. they just wanted to say what was going to happen and make it seem as if it was real instead of just a good story. So the whole movie is a bit of a waste,0
" This movie is one of the most ridiculous movies ever made. First off, the cast was terrible. They were poor actors that were thick asNOTHING. Second, the movie was so bad that it basically meant that it was a waste of time to go to see the movie. Now that you know i'm not comparing this movie to other movies that have a lot of",0
 I rutally liked the sci-fi by the time I saw it but I think it was accidentally dragged into the sci-fi trap by a bunch of humans. I'd rather stay away from any of the sci-fi this movie should be from the beginning. The plot was boring and pointless and really confusing as you see intergalactic starships do things to each,0
 I liked the picture it was a nice look at the early days of the rocket ship. It was also very funny and I liked the whole idea of the film. I really liked it. ,0
" This movie what i'd say is a decent movie that's actually pretty good, because it has the whole concept of the atomic bomb coming about but not as it was described in the movie. It has the same story but it's a different story, but i guess it wouldn't have been able to be aired last year because it was a lot of factors that made this movie",0
" As I begin describing the plot of this comedy, I feel that I should be careful what I say. This film doesn't deserve to be described as a comedy at all. It is a science fiction film. A kind of ""Star Trek"" with a little bit of The Twilight Zone thrown in. But in this type of sci-fi film, the writers would never have",0
" How about this, my daughter and I went and saw this movie, it was the 6th in the series this month: ive seen it twice already, once last year, and i thought it was a bit of a waste of time.

" I think it's a good thing that there are a lot of films that are a bit more adventurous and adventurous than usual.

I think the reason why there are a lot of bad movies like this",0
" I was really looking forward to this film because I was a fan and have seen it before on TV where the part played by the actors was really good.

 The cast was actually one good. But the director and the writers were a bunch of total stupid geeks who made a flick amount of trash.

" Although I was not sure what to expect from this one, I was pleasantly surprised. This film is about the creation of a musical opera of 23 works by two artists that were supposed to be used.

 I was thoroughly enjoying this subtle comedy when I saw it. I thought it would be interesting to watch someone who was not exactly the best of friends.

 I've been watching this movie for like a year and i really enjoy it. I think there is a lot of potential in this movie if the film executives take the time to give it some care.

 This is the best movie i have seen in a long time. The director is so good that you will not notice that there is an overused character. The acting is great and the story isn't boring.

" I know what I'm talking about. The movie is poorly written, badly directed, and deeply unfunny.

" The best part of the movie for me was the robots. I had seen the movie in theaters a couple of weeks ago and was intrigued. I decided it wasn't wasted my time. They did a lot of work to make them look real. I was always surprised at the fact that the robots were literally attached to the TV. Also, there was a scene where the robots",0
" I can't really remember much about the story; in fact it was more of a sketch and sketch straight from the MST3K DVD. It's still a very good sketch, but you'd be hard pressed to say it was anything more than that.

The story is really interesting and well done. But the directing is abysmal. The movie was done with a high-school setup, and all of the places we see are filmed in high school",0

The movie is one that is off-putting, but",0
 I thought this film was rather good from the start. A great cast which ranged from British comedians to American freaks. It was my first viewing experience of the film and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

The elderly couple, a criminal couple who have been rocked by tragedy in their lives, who thought their lives were going in the right direction after seeing the movie.

 I honestly don't understand this movie. If you move the dialogue to some other character you have to look at the emoticon of the other one and the clues you shove into the other person's eyes to figure out what the joke is.
