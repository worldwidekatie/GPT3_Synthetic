0," Let me just say that this movie is not funny at all, not even by accident! I cannot understand why anybody would give this film a positive review. I got an award from work for watching this movie, but that's all. I had to fast forward through most of the sex scene and at one point, I just had to put it down and walked away because I",1
1," ""City of God"" has been a critical and audience favorite for years. I've just finally decided to watch it and people were right... it's an unforgettable, powerful, and challenging piece of cinema. It's a film about violence, desperation, and the sins of the past, but it's not a film for the faint of heart... Brace yourself... REVIEW",1
2," HOW CAN ANYONE NOT LIKE THIS FILM!!?!?!?!?! It's got the best ending ever,and it's got a GREAT message. I'd recommend this film to anyone who's life is in need of an Adventure! ",1
3," Where to begin? ""Requiem for a Dream"" is about the first movie I've seen that makes me think - ""Wow, now I know how movies are really made."" This is a movie with a message that should be taken to heart by every young person in the country. This is a movie that really leaves a mark. It was so intense that I saw it",1
4," I recently had the opportunity to take my 15 year old daughter to see this movie on the big screen. She had read the book and I had read the book. The movie was very well done. It was fast paced, had lots of action, and it was never boring. I had read the book and had my doubts on how they would be able to take this book",1
5," Honestly, this is a really good movie. As I often am, I was extremely wary when I found it on the shelf. I didin't think it would be any good, but I thought I'd give it a shot, given that Adam Sandler is the leading man. I couldn't have been happier. The movie is really cool. It's pretty much your",1
6," When I first viewed ""Coming Of Age,"" I did not know what to think of it. I did not know whether parents would find it offensive or not. Now, several years later, I have a completely different view of ""Coming Of Age"" and it has become one of my favorite movies of all time. Most people will find it shocking and very offensive for a variety",1
7," I have seen these two movies in cinema when I was a boy. Both were showing with a single ticket. I remember when I saw these two films in a double bill, I was very disappointed with ""Quatermass 2"" because I was expecting what I saw in ""Quatermass and the Pit"" but I found that sequel so boring. However, these two films",1
8," An endearing, touching, and hilarious film portraying the life of a young man of humble beginnings coming into his own. While the songs are not as quotable as the ones from ""High of the Curves,"" ""Dumb & Dumber,"" and ""There's Something About Mary,"" they're still good. Even the stalker song is fun. This is an entertaining",1
9," One of my most beloved films. I've seen this so many times that I could pick up on something I had missed before. I absolutely love everything about this movie. I bought the soundtrack two years ago and will take it with me on a fun trip someday, knowing the whole soundtrack by heart. It's got great acting, a great plot, and amazing characters. It",1
10, A very moving movie... The story is good and fast moving... The acting is superb... A must see movie for all who love love stories. ,1
11," There was a time when a movie like this would not have been made with a black lead. I believe that this movie was an important cultural event even though it was panned by the critics. It may be important for other reasons too, but this one is the biggie. ",1
12," This was a good movie, but not very funny. I am a fan of broad-comedies, but this was too broad, too vulgar, too gross for me. I can say that I enjoyed parts of it, but I'd be hard pressed to recommend this movie to anyone. 2/5 ",1
13," my girlfriend bought me this dvd. she thought it would be a great romantic movie. well man, let me tell ya something, you don't want to watch a movie like that with a female on your lap. that's right, if you've seen the movie, you know what i'm talkin' about. not only is the underwear scene one of the most",1
14, What can I say? I know this movie from start to finish. It's hilarious. It's an strong link to my past and will change the way I view film in the future. Hypothetically speaking :) The down-fall? There's no Socrates Johnson! ,1
15," This is the first time I've seen this film, since I bought the DVD last year. The main idea I got was that it was a neo-noir crime thriller, and that there was no romance between the two main protagonists (I had read the synopsis on Amazon). The idea of a romantic crime thriller was why I bought it. Now, I'm not saying",1
16, I have been dabbling in making movies for about 10 years now. I started making short films with my friends while in college and have been at it ever since. I know how hard it can be to get your film out there for people to see because many of my own have not been completed due to lack of interest from others or the fact that I would never be able,1
17," This movie is on the top of my list of favorites, it's like the scene where Skeets tells you how he got his suit, and who made it for him. It's in the comic book, it's in the movie, it's in the book and it's all good! ",1
18," This is an intense film. The subject matter is very dark, and I found myself getting caught up in the characters, hoping that things would work out for them. That is how you know a movie is good...when you are really involved with it! The acting is superb. It's hard to imagine A-list actors doing a better job. I also like the """,1
19, I saw the film as a teenager many years ago when it first came out and was blown away by it. I have seen it many times since and it just gets better. It includes so many great scenes that lodge themselves in your head forever. There are so many elements of this film that are amazing and I can not recommend it more highly. The opening fight sequence against the,1
20," This is a very good movie. Kevin Bacon really does a great job in this movie. I did think it was a little slow though. When I say slow I don't mean boring, it was a drama, it just went real slow. I think Kevin Bacon should have won an award for this movie because he did such a phenomenal job. If you like Kevin Bacon you",1
21," I have seen this movie three times and I love it. I love how the movie is a comedy and it has action and it is about people who are very close. It is about these three guys who are childhood friends that graduate from college and they get jobs and they all live together. The main characters are Adam Sandler (playing the part of Rob Schneider, David Sp",1
22," This is a great history of animation!!!! It spans from the early days of animation to the present, with stops in between. Ralph Bakshi is a master of animation and it shows in this film. In the past I have been very critical of his work, but in this one he really outdid himself. The animation is a combination of 2-D and computer animation.",1
23," This movie is fantastic! It has an excellent cast, the story is great, and it is very original. I love the movie. It is a heart-wrenching movie. It is emotional, but not corny. I think everyone should see this movie. There are a lot of things in this movie that can make you laugh, cry, or make you angry",1
24," What a great movie. I had the pleasure of seeing this when I was a kid. I wonder why this movie is not one of the classics of all time. It is an enchanting tale of a fairy tale prince trying to find true love, and I'm sure many princes must have tried to copy this one. ",1
25," This review is for the original black & white version. The color version (which is much easier and cheaper to make) was made later. It is also very good, though, and one of my favorite films. ",1
26," My father took me to see this movie in the theater when he was in town for my brothers wedding. He got the tickets for us as a kind, but I so loved the movie that we actually went out and bought out own copy that week. I love it when he comes to visit because we spend time talking and laughing about the movie. I am going to buy it",1
27," I remember watching this film, and being amazed at it. It is the best stop-motion movie I have ever seen. The puppets were so natural and lifelike. The story is an original, and I haven't seen anything like it, before or since. The movie was made in 1971, and the special effects are amazing. It was filmed at a time",1
28," This movie has everything. It has the comedy, the action, the drama, and the characters you can relate to. I saw this movie in the movie theater and I loved it. I've seen this movie over 5 times and still love it. I love the actors and actresses in this movie. I wish they made a second one because it is a classic. REVIEW",1
29," This was the best show ever, and it was canceled? No one could play Missy Devereaux like Patricia Clarkson. Lisa Edelstein was also great as Julie. I would have loved to see more of the relationship between Julie and C.J. Between them, they were the greatest. Zack Braff was good, but he could have been better. A lot",1
30, One of the best films I have ever seen! Nic Cage is amazing in this role. It's one of those rare films that you can watch over again and appreciate different aspects of the movie. ,1
31," This movie is really great. The only reason I am giving it such a bad rating is because of the ending. I am not going to discuss the ending, but when it was in the middle of the movie I was wishing it would never end. I'm not going to discuss it because that would be spoiler alert, but I will say that I was very disappointed by the",1
32, Saw this movie last night and loved it. I think it was a great movie. It is a bit slow moving at first but by the end of the movie I was on the edge of my seat. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes to be well entertained. Sandra Bullock is at her best in this movie and I would love to see her in more,1
33," This movie is super fun to watch. It's a great movie if your a die hard fan of the Farscape television series. I really enjoyed watching this film. The film doesn't follow the exact storyline of the TV series, but it's really exciting to watch. It takes place a couple of years after the events of the series and tells the story of how John",1
34," *****SPOILERS**** I loved this movie, it was good fun, better than any of the Jason Bourne movies. I'm not comparing the two but this movie is great, not just because of Liam Neeson, but because of the whole Ben Affleck and Jon Voight thing that was going on, I don't want to give anything away but the",1
35," I own this movie and think it's very good. It's quiet, nice and a little sad, but so is the book. I think the basic idea that people need to be reminded that life is not about ability or what you can do, but about what you do with what you have. I use this movie in my class when I teach values in the classroom.",1
36, I have watched this movie many times. The first time I watched it was because of my mom and dad who are huge fans of this movie. I have watched it with them time and time again. The storyline is awesome and the characters are so very well written. The actors that they chose for the voice overs are not ones that you would believe would be in a fantasy movie,1
37," I thought this movie was really good. It has a really cool plot with great special effects! I think Laur and Heidi looked really good together. I know a lot of people think that the acting is bad in this movie, but it's really not that bad. There are better examples of bad acting than this movie. I didn't really like the ending. I thought that",1
38," This is one of my favorite movies, I've seen it a couple times already. It's got a great voice cast, including Gena Davis as Mavis, Eddie Murphy as Mushu, and of course, an 11-year old Drew Barrymore as Lilo. The story is very touching and heartwarming. If you don't cry at least once when the credits",1
39," Just watched ""Blair Witch,"" and thought it was pretty cool--definitely creepy with a good soundtrack, and I look forward to part 2! ",1
40," I've watched this movie numerous times. Its just plain, pure, 100% fun. I love the John Hughes feel to it, and I love the 80's vibe. I also love that it's set in and around Chicago, which I'm from, but this movie makes you feel like you're actually there. It's a great movie to watch if you need to",1
41," This is a fascinating film. It takes a unique cinematic approach to the word ""documentary."" It shows you the events (such as the assassination of JFK) unfold from several viewpoints in a linear fashion, in real time, and in real places - as if you yourself were there. You feel the tension, fear, and chaos as you watch it all unfold. You also",1
42," A thoroughly enjoyable film. Kevin Kline is superb as ever. He really ought to have won the oscar for this role. And I give mad respect to Paul Scofield for his role as a very convincing, almost ""benevolent"" SS General. I still believe that this would have been a better film (and won the oscar for best screenplay) had it",1
43," I have watched it a few times now and I still enjoy it immensely. I think that Jessica Alba is an extremely good looking lady, and she does a really good job with this movie. If you like action, you should like this movie. If you like a good love story, you should like this movie. It's pretty much an action movie with a good love",1
44, This is an excellent film about an ex-convict and his various experiences on the way to his revenge and freedom. ,1
45, This is a sickening movie purveying the false belief that all men are the same and that all women are stupid. I'm not going to belabor the point. It's sickening. ,1
46," Rarely has a film been more deserving of the over-used term ""cult classic."" it's a film that has been admiringly discussed, quoted from and endlessly parodied by those who were lucky enough to have known it. it's a film that's perfectly suited to the needs of critics and academics. it's a film that has never been copyrighted or shown on",1
47," This movie is a fun choice for those who enjoy shows such as Everybody Loves Raymond or King of Queens. However, I may be alone in thinking that the show does not hold up well on repeated viewings. The characters are all very likable, and the show has a quirky charm. However, the show is also quite predictable and the jokes are rather limited. Even",1
48," It's the kind of movie you watch again and again. It is sad, funny, thrilling, and everything in between. The movie has a way of leaving you thinking about it long after you've seen it.<br /><br />What's not to love? The characters are great. The acting is great. There is a lot of scenery and editing, and a",1
49," This is a wonderful film! It's a little slow at first because it takes a while to introduce all the characters, but you will be glad you didn't stop watching it before it gets to the good parts. The actual story takes place in the late 1800's (1898 to be exact), but can really be applied to today's world. Character development for the main",1

57," The reason this movie worked is because of the acting. Jordan was great, but the rest of the cast, from the precocious little treasure that is Ellar to the great Andre Braugher, were all in top form. This is a good movie, and a good action flick, with a satisfying ending. ",1
58," This is a first film, and thus unlikely to win any awards, but it is an inventive and engrossing little horror movie set in a remote region of Russia. I found it philosophical and even transcendent, which is fine, because it is about the end of the world. ",1
59," A great suspense thriller (and I mean thriller as in the old sense of the word, not the modern sense of the word) with some of the best music/score that I have ever heard. What the movie does is take three different stories; murder mystery, political thriller and love story, and intertwine them beautifully. The thing that is great about the movie is that",1

The play is about two brothers (one older and one younger) and their father. (The older brother is played by Peter O'Toole.) The father dis",1
62," I was surprised to find that this movie has mixed reviews. I found it highly entertaining and thought the actors were nearly perfect for the parts and the casting was a good choice. Jason Lee fit the role of the father, Ben Gannon, a man that is battling a struggle between good and evil. I like the fact that he didn't redeem himself just because he found out",1

101," Ok, I have to say that normally I hate the stereotypical Hollywood ending, where the male lead ends up with the female lead after the female lead has been misled by the male's best friend.

I've seen more than a few of the movies with the same plot, but",1

128, Let me start off by saying that this is the Fast and the Furious franchise's strongest entry to date. It's very well made and it is loaded with exciting and cinematic action scenes.

202," Absolute rubbish. When I first watched it in the 80s I thought it was a fine film. I've watched it a few times since, and it seems increasingly daft.<br /><br />But I think the worst thing about it is the message. The Russians (or they might as well be) are stupid. Stone age. They are incapable of organising anything",1
203," The cover of the DVD case for this 2-disc special edition is a little misleading, as it shows a photo of a young man being held back by a policeman as he tries to intervene in his parents' arrest.

The performance of Ben Stiller was very well done. I have to say that I liked him in the movie. He should do more dramas I think.,1
302," This is a must see movie for anyone who has ever had to deal with so-called ""tough love"". It's very sad that movies like this don't get the hype that they so richly deserve.

The truth is that I think that,1

310," This was a fun movie to watch. It was a crazy, frantic adventure that had great action, drama, and humor. It was funny to see the sorcerer's apprentice as a child. The story was original, it wasn't a re-make of the first. The animation was great. It was very entertaining, and you would have to be a real Scrooge",1

Using crappy effects, horrible",1

And, while there is certainly an interesting twist on the usual courtroom movie",1

321," Without a doubt, the best movie of the year. The parallel stories of the FBI and the Italians were great, and the script was perfect. I also loved that each character tells his or her own story. This is significant because it lets you know what each character thinks of himself or herself. This film was like a great mob tale where you knew you were watching the downfall",1

This is a movie for the whole family to enjoy. It",1
332," The casting of the two main roles in this movie was inspired. The pairing of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau made for an almost unending stream of priceless humor. Matthau was able to bring the great variety of traits of the three friends to full, hilarious life, while Lemmon's exuberant energy kept Matthau from getting too over-the-top.<",1
333, This movie is a great movie about a young man's search to find meaning in his life.

336, I got this movie because I am a fan of the show. It's fun to see some of the other characters from the show. The plot has plenty of action and the twist is pretty cool. I think it's a good way to spend a Saturday. If you like shows from the 70's I think you'll like this. ,1

I suggest if you were,0
27," I'm not sure if I'm a fan of this movie. It's definitely not the worst I've seen, but it's not the best either. I think it's a movie that can go either way with people. The actors who were considered kind of 'out there' at the time (like Christian Bale) are not as surprising to me as they would have been",0
28," This was a pretty far-fetched movie. I mean how can a group of misfits even hope to be successful after stealing a very expensive car? Well, I guess they were just that good. If you liked ""The Italian Job"" then you will probably like this one as well. ",0
29," In the past I have read some of the worst reviews of this movie, but over time (and repeated viewings) I have come to appreciate this great comedy. It has a great cast of characters, good comedy, and a great meaning behind it. The humor is a little more subtle then some of the other 80's comedies, but that doesn't stop it from",0
30," Another movie I lost interest in early, and which I almost quit on several times throughout the movie. While the fight sequences are quite good, the dialog and the scenery is really unexciting, and the ending, which is supposed to be intense, is quite dull and was quite hard to get through. As the movie started out, the dialog was rather boring, and I",0
31," I'm a fan of both the original and this new version of the classic horror film ""The Blob"". The original was directed by Irvin Schlesinger, produced by Jack H. Harris, and written by Harry Essex. The film starred Steve McQueen (The getaway) and Aneta Corsaut (Forbidden Planet) and the blob itself was portrayed by director",0
32," One of THE worst movies of all time. Take a movie director that has never made a feature film and then give him a budget of more than 150 million dollars. It's sad that such a promising actor as Liev Schrieber is in such an AWFUL, annoying, film. Just awful. It is the ACTUAL definition of a 'guilty pleasure', when",0
33," I really wanted to like this film, but I just couldn't love it. The story is really predictable and has little twists, which I found to be kind of insulting. I almost felt as if the film was trying to make me feel dumb. It was a lot like being at a party where you know most of the people there, but you're not sure what to",0
34," I'm a huge fan of The Velvet Underground, and this film is a much needed documentary. I'm not sure exactly why but many people seem to forget about the VU and all of the amazing music they made. The movie is filled with interviews with band members, friends, family, and just interesting people. The thing I really liked about the movie is that the people",0

37," A bit of a let down as a follow up to this directors earlier effort. The film is entertaining but nowhere near as enjoyable as the superior ""The Dreamers"". Still this film is not without it's share of positive attributes, including one of the most spectacular dinner parties ever filmed and a neat collection of 80's subculture ferns. ",0
38," BORING BORING BORING, if you want to see a great movie watch an old version of this ""KING KONG"" instead. There's to much talking and not enough action in this movie. The only thing I liked in this movie was King Kong and the action before he dies. ",0
39," The first of several movies about ""men in black"" by Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, this is a pretty entertaining movie. It's just a fun little action flick with a bit of sci-fi. Tommy Lee Jones plays a more minor role in this one, but he does a great job. Will Smith isn't bad either in his first leading role, but he",0
40," What can I say? This movie is the definition of ""so bad its good"". It possesses all the elements of a classic b movie (ex. Bad acting, cheesy effects, no plot, etc.), but is still, in a sense, entertaining for those who truly appreciate b movies. As for me, I'm not sure if I can really explain why this movie is",0
41," The first time i saw this, i was expecting a great movie. But it just wasn't that. There was a lot of screaming, fighting, blood, and a very bad plot. I would never recommend this movie to ANYONE. I was very disappointed. I really don't know how it got made, or why it was greenlit when it was so bad.",0
42," I went to see the movie, and was very interested and excited to see it. First off, I thought the whole movie was the best I have ever seen, the special effects were cool, the acting was cool, and the story was cool. I think every one should see this movie. ",0
43, I think that this movie is very good. It tells a lot about the past about the time when people were less civilized. I didn't really like the way they had the horses being followed around. It sort of ruined the movie and made it less interesting. I think that Gregory Peck is a wonderful actor. I can't believe that he made so many movies. I can,0
44," Poor film... but, pretty damn funny. ",0
45, This is a really good but kind of sad movie. I like it because it is sort of like a fantasy. I think it is just about a girl who has a horrible life and wants to get away. It is a good film but I do not know why they would make it like that in the middle of summer. I think she wanted to escape from the world and,0
46," I don't know what was the most awful thing about this movie. If you want to see a movie without a plot, buy a lot of expensive popcorn, find a comfortable spot to sit, and watch lots of pretty pictures revolving around the love story between a young couple. You might even fall asleep, because it's so boring. If you want to see a mystery,",0
47," I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was unique and I enjoyed the story. The effects were great, the story was well done and the actors pulled off a lot more ""layers"" than I expected. I thought I was going to be bored but was I ever wrong. It was an adventure that kept me guessing and wanting to see what would happen next",0
48, This film was so bad it wasn't even funny. I rented this one thinking that a horror film about a killer doll would be right up my alley. I was wrong. This was one of the worst movies I have seen. The bad guy toy was just pathetic. The plot was stupid. I just wish I had stayed home and watched some of the other scary movies available,0
49," I think this is the best movie ever. It is so cool. I showed my friends and they thought it was cool too. I liked the part where they were in the jungle with the dinosaurs and the part where they blew up the dinosaurs heads. It is the coolest movie I ever seen with dinosaurs and guns. Michael Biehn is soooooooooo cool, and there is",0

51," As a movie this is alright. Not great but not bad. It's an action film that has some well done action scenes and an ending that seems to come out of nowhere. I don't know who the screen writer was but I would say ""hold on there buddy. I thought we were making a serious drama here and then you throw in a bad guys with a jet",0
52," This movie is ok. But I wouldn't pay to see it. I first thought that it was just average but as it went on it got worse. I'm a fan of films like ""the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" and ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" but I can't say that this one is my favorite. The actors are",0

The movie has wonderful, often humorous, sometimes touching moments, but I think the overall",0
54," I have to agree with the bad reviews, all though it didn't seem that bad from the trailers. This film had a very slow start and it took a while to get into it. Once it did though, it became a very exciting film. A very good movie that makes you want to watch more. I think it should have gotten better reviews than it did, following",0
55," Even at an age of 12, I thought this movie was a complete joke. I mean, it had the potential to be a good film, it just had a terrible script. Everything from the beginning to the end just made this movie seem as if it was so rushed. The script was terrible, the acting even worse and just overall, it was so poorly made. This",0

So they get a private investigator to find out. The investigator is a very stupid",0
58," This is the worst movie I ever saw. Not even worth it for a laugh. A friend of mine and I rented it and thought it would be funny. It was so bad we had to turn it off. You get to a point in the movie where you want to stop watching it, but then you think, ""there's no way this movie can get worse.""",0
59," I was completely disappointed with this movie. Although I didn't have high expectations, I was still hoping for some sort of plot to be there. But there's nothing, just some flashbacks, flashbacks of the flashback and then some flashbacks of the flashbacks of the flashbacks. It's just boring and uninteresting. When the end comes, I'm surprised. I'm surprised that it",0
60," This movie is a very good one, if you don't know the ending. I like this movie because it is funny, and it is one of them movies that you don't know the ending. That is one of the things that I like. So if you like that type of movie then you should really watch this movie. Another thing that I like about this movie is",0
61," This is the worst movie I've ever seen. It made no sense and the writing was awful. I have never seen a movie with so many pointless scenes where nothing happens. Even the scene where they find the ""cure"" for the disease was pointless. I would have given this movie zero stars if that were an option. The acting was lackluster and the script... well",0
62," What you have here is a whole lot of scares, some laughs, some gore, some nudity, and a whole lot of funny. This was one of the best horror films in the 80s (and maybe even in the 90s). The story really isn't that good. It's about this team of commandos (including an ex-president of the U.S",0
63," If you can get past the poor VHS transfer, you'll find this a fun little exploitation flick. I'm the perfect audience for this movie because I love lurid schlock from the 70s. Sure, the picture quality is pretty bad, and the dubbing is a little off, but overall, this film is a fun little romp that you can fast-",0
64," I know it's not the best out there, but it was the first movie I ever saw with Rosanna Arquette (and that's good enough for me), so I give it an extra star. I also love the scene when they're at the beach house & she's humming the song that she sang when she performed under the name ""novelty act""",0
65," This film was quite amusing, but like some of the other films reviewed on this site; I cant figure out why it's seen as a classic. It's a comedy, but not the type that will leave you rolling on the floor. It's a short film, but did not achieve the goal of quick laughs. Perhaps in it's day it was well liked, but",0

67, A very nice movie. It's not really a horror film. It's more like a science fiction fantasy. Vincent Price is a nice actor. It's really a good movie to sit down and enjoy. I think that it's one of the best horror films that I've seen. The movie is quite long but you won't be bored. I really like the idea of,0
68," This movie is an interesting example of the way US culture assimilates foreign mythic material, or simply steals from it, and then recasts it in a new format. The original Japanese ""Godzilla"", released in 1954, was a bizarre, original creature feature that presented the story of a prehistoric sea monster awakened when US atomic testing in the Pacific Ocean disturbs a dormant dinosaur",0
69," I've never been a fan of Eddie Murphy. He's a very hit-or-miss actor, but when he hits he hits hard. ""48 Hours"" is a perfect example of this; it's one of his best films. In ""Coming To America"" he mixes a little fat and a little skinny to come out with a piece of Hollywood cheese. The film",0
70," This movie sucked. It's cliche. You can predict everything that's going to happen. there's nothing new about it. It's just a bunch of kids trying to find a treasure out in the woods. Oh yeah, and the scary voice over the walkie-talkie! How original. I can't believe they actually made a movie about this. I mean",0
71," In 5 words: unoriginal, predictable, stupid, cheesy, cheap. This is the kind of movie that almost made me regret seeing such a great cast wasted in a film like this. I mean come on! It's got Rutger Hauer, Ron Perlman, Malcolm McDowell and and some other actors that I don't know but who are famous. I thought",0
72, I love it when Valentina is being a sex kitten in this video. The complete reverse is also too much to take for me.

This is the only video that I have seen of Valentina that I,0

75, This movie is nothing but a waste of time. I'm all for a movie with a great plot and characters that you can care about but most of the movie is boring.

78," I love, love, love this movie. It is so wonderfully, wonderfully crafted. The acting is terrific, the dialogue is crisp and pithy without degenerating into self-conscious cleverness.

She teams up with a rough-",0

88, While watching this film I had to laugh at the fact that this is a film about the near future and it is already dated.
