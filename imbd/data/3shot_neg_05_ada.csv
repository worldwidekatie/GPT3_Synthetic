" i think that this movie is the worst movie i've ever seen. it's so horrible and terrible that i can't believe that anyone would put it on the list, but i guess your right! ",0
 i'm gonna be really upstaged when i watch this on DVD i mean i'm at least going to have a bit of fun. But this is a movie that is very dull and very bad at its own game this is why i hate to only watch this on DVD. ,0
" i was gonna make this a star rating but i couldnt, it's so bad, i hate to say it but i think the movie is a total joke, a bunch of morons in a movie that is meant for kids but actually is very bad. the actors are horrid im especially disgusted with joe the director and the good actor rockford who is a very",0
" this movie is something else. I kinda like this movie because i think the actors did a wonderful job. There's alot of reasons why the movie is good. Its not a typical cheeseball movie, it has a strong sense of atmosphere and its a good introduction to themeres and ideas. Its is beautiful. The special effects are good. the animation looks cool. RE",0
 (like i said i had it on repeat) i love this movie and i laughed a lot. (including some times when my mum was a bit more cool than me because of the jokes in this movie like the time when the little girl was a soldier who got everything she wanted and guesstimated because she was told a place was near a Dutch boy she had been,0
 I think this movie is awful! It wasn't good at all. I thought it could have been good if they had taken the time and expense to do an excellent movie instead of just using the same old stuff over and over again. For one thing the actors did a horrible job and for another it was really bad. ,0
 <br /><br />This is the worst movie ever made. The actors are idiots who are either straight up murderers or are just so out of it they don't even know what's going on. I don't know the difference. I don't want to talk about the plot because it's none of my business. I don't want to talk about the actors.,0
 well yeah i have seen lots of worse movies and i have to agree with all the person who says this movie is the worst movie ive ever seen. i think it was the first time i saw this movie and i also think it was the worst movie i have ever seen it was to bad so bad in fact i looked up all the critics who have said this and the,0
" This film was not very good, the level of it's jokes and the plot failed to be serious...The story was completely stupid. I was ashamed to have watched it. This is one of the worst action movie i have ever seen it has to be so bad to be good as a comedy film. This is not a comedy. The action scenes did not get that funny",0
" yes i agree what were you expecting to see. Well in this case the only ""message"" this movie got was in the ballyhoo of the players of the Moonbase. how cute. I guess it was a good effort and a good movie to come to a conclusion to the story of the moonbase and like i said in my previous review i thought the special",0

is the name of my favorite movie. ",0

" i played this film with the whole family and the family had a blast. While i found it more of a comedy in many senses than a serious piece of work, i think the time shift from 1950 through 1970 was well done. I think it was hard to be upset with the movie, it was so wrong and so off-putting. I wish they could have also",0
" seriously i ive seen many a movie in my life and some are immeasurable and some are only average. But an awful movie like this is immeasurable. a heavy dose of stupidity, a heavy dose of that half assed sci-fi that's all around us i mean this movie is just such an awful piece of garbage. The bad acting couldn",0
 this was a really good movie and it was good to see Joel and the robot out in public. It wasnt perfect of course because the script sucked but i still thought it was a good movie. So overall it was a good movie. I would recommend this movie to kids and it was a good movie. The songs on the movie were good too. ,0
" (meaning it was rubbish to me) This is a compilation of the best Star Trek fanfic that i've ever read. It's not an autobiography, more a series of essays on various Star Trek movies and the fandom. I will let it speak for itself. <br> [link] <br>",0
" i had no idea this was a remake of a picture that was already in a completely different genre of a movie. It's a real shame but it's plain to see this was made for the money and that is why they didn't screw up the story. This movie is a complete waste of time, and the most successful MST3K movie of all time. RE",0
 thats a stupid idea. Which isnt funny. Theres plenty of crap out there that isnt funny. You dont have to make it a comedy cuz no one is laughing any more. So how does a film like that become a comedy???? Heres a better idea thats really funny........ ,0
 I was in my late teens when this movie came out. I was a BS student at the time and i was completely oblivious to the fact that RUSH VENGEANCE was being released at the time. My friend and I rented the movie. What we saw was the original RUSH VENGEANCE and it was a joke movie. We found out that RUSH,0
" this movie really hasn't had a better chance in its movie life. It had the best special effects in history, and they even got the music in there. But it's a movie that doesn't really have a purpose. A bunch of guys start a spaceship and go off a cliff and the only thing that happens is that they screw up a couple of times and completely screw",0
" This movie is a bit too long for my taste and wasn't really knowing the story anyway, but i didn't mind watching it. It was pretty boring. ",0
" I could not even understand the movie! It was the worst movie, the worst movie, I'll ever see. I watched it because I liked it. I didn't know what to think. I didnt know the characters. ",0
" A man of fuel with no shirt, who tries to jump from a ten story building without a helmet, and a pilot named Ralph Johnson, author of ""The Titan Effect"" who wants to fly but fucks up after landing. Then he's cinced out of his money so he can make his escape into space. It's all blown up in this film, really",0
" This is one of the most disappointing films of the year. I've seen it the first time, and then again and again. I would be with the baddest person ever, but they yank out of my arms and kick the hell out of me.<br /><br />I will say I was pleasantly surprised by director L. Ron Hubbard's last film.<br",0
" It's hard to ignore the obvious sexism of the movie. The male lead is a man, and he's a man in a movie, so what? The MST3K characters are women, but they're only a few of them. They seem so many to have one or two male characters, but they basically are the same. The MST3K team,",0

" this is an entertaining movie. The acting is fairly good, but the stories are a little predictable. I found the sound almost as irritating as the subtitles. ",0
 I'm not even going to give a review of this movie. I watched it once and the best thing about it was the soundtrack music. I think it was the soundtrack of this movie. ,0
 This is a good movie. It is very good. I enjoyed it. Tonight I will watch it again. The story of this movie was not bad at all. You will laugh at the part of the story that you liked. I enjoyed every part of it. Just don't like this movie. ,0
 this is a movie i never watch but many people are going to like it. This is a dirty trashy movie that you can't stay away from. It's really a dirty trashy movie. Its a dirty trashy movie that was intended to be a filthy trashy movie. The movie is so bad that you can't believe what its like. The script is so,0
" This has a bad reputation. But one must realize that in the movie's case, it's mostly due to the stars: Brent Gilroy and Steve Urkel. Wow, they are the worst actors I have ever seen in my life. This has only been proved by the fact that they got a ""gotcha"" in the movie by sneaking a little of their line that",0
" It's a classic. I wore out the DVD. It's a good movie. Its the best movie i've seen in the last fifteen years. It's a great movie. I thought it was great as a whole and just about my favorite movie so far in the theater. But in order to see it, we had to rent the DVD. You would never get out",0
" This film made the people of Richmond (Virginia), who were already part of the war effort, sick about the existence of the U.S.A.R.S., and caused a stir in that far-flung state by furthering the Communist cause by shooting down a plane and causing a panic. I had seen one or two of these films on video, but",0
" This is a film I reccomended to my friends. I just reccomend you rent this movie because it is bad. It is bad, and it is wasting your time. ",0
" Visually, ""Rocketship X-M"" is visually bad; this movie has a martian vibe but the effects are too low to make a good sci-fi movie. The movie is filthy, and I personally don't get it. It takes way too much time to watch this thing. ",0
" Anyone who has ever been around the world can attest to the fact that when it comes to the arts the world has a few problems. There is the problem of debtors and porters. The debtors, in the form of the highly touted ""astronaut"" idea, have been losing ground, while the porters have made it into the heart of the movie industry",0
" ""Rocketship X-M"", a period drama about a man's race against time to keep his newfound discoveries from being revealed, has its share of issues. The only redeeming quality is that director Robert Aldrich is good at storytelling. He makes sure you get a fair amount of emotional involvement in this beloved tale. This modest piece of hand-made cinema is mostly",0
 This is the best movie i have ever saw. I love this movie. The hyper-stylist (the act that make the star look the part) twins and the robot seems to love making you feel shitty. She is so stupid about things and a complete idiot. And she cries in the shower but from the second they get into the shower the movie is all fun,0
" Biggest classic ever. A very sobering, somber, and serious film. Rob Mankine and the RSC play their parts very well. I admit to being a little annoyed at the dopey direction that the script was written by the young man's director, Philip Boone (it was his first film and is widely believed to be his worst). ",0
" This is a science fiction movie that is a bit too good for many reasons. First, the visuals are good; the sound effects are good, and the special effects are good. And, of course, you know why there are no aliens or cars in the movie. The alien concept is obviously very original (beginning with the idea of ""X-Men"" director James",0
" While this movie did not have the formula of a complex science fiction movie, it did feature impressive acting from lesser known actors, especially from the first two acts of the movie. The first act of the movie features John Carradine, who appears in the film in a brief cameo as a race car driver sauntering through the streets of a small town. Carradine",0
" The basic story of ""Rocketship X-M"" is a fairly straightforward one: a man who landed a rocket on a moon mission accidentally ends up having a strange reaction, in which he gets abducted by a strange alien race. The aliens then kidnap and brainwash the man into the X-Men and begin an attempt to build a rocket which would be able to go",0
" ""Rocketship X-M"" is based on the real-life story of the invention of an interplanetary rocket ship by the visionary and imaginative truck driver, Dixon Henderson. Henderson had simply invented the rocket ship with a simple design - a rocket engine attached to the top of the rocket ship where the rocket would propel it up to the surface of the moon. He",0
" ""Rocketship X-M"", a short documentary about a group of international nuclear scientists seeking new energy sources, was first conceived as a documentary produced for NASA's ""Popular Science"".

" ""Destination Moon"" is a prequel to ""Star Trek"", an off-beat sci-fi flick which seems to pay homage to ""Star Wars"".

" This movie actually isn't like the other mock-ups we've seen. It is much better and much better than the others, and many of you will disagree with me. This movie is far more interesting than the others because it DEFINITELY shows what can be done with the Michael Bay standard of taking a giant spaceship (in this case, a shuttle) and creating",0
" This film's premise is as follows: The Mars mission of the U.S.S. Mercury and the Soviet Union's Earth-orbiting space station, the S.S. Venus is orbiting the Earth. Bob Robertson (Michael Rooker) is a NASA astronaut who knows that most of the space station's essential systems are out of commission. Consequently, he's",0
" This is the kind of movie that you cannot wait to let the kids watch alone because they will probably love it. But the kids will probably hate it, but you can't win against those people. The movie will probably be ruined by its inability to clearly define the roles of the characters. It's very well-executed, but this is a studio movie, so the",0
" I guess this would be a movie for diehard sci-fi fans. If you play back the movies of old, then you will find that ""Rocketship X-M"" is really, really, really bad. The only thing I don't really get from this movie is the audacity to call it an ""exploration"" of the interstellar realm, much like",0
" It's hard to tell how many times this movie has been seen since it debuted on TV. Back in the early 60s, this movie was a hit. To put it into context, in the 1940s, ""Star Trek"" was a major hit. All of this makes it even more fitting that ""Rocketships X-M"" is my favorite film of all",0
" This is a very dark film in the vein of ""The Gate"" and ""The Thing"". The story starts out a little differently than ""Rocketship X-M"". The men's group is trying to get to ""Destination Moon"" without the help of the aliens and they have a problem. The men refuse to use the spaceship at all, and get their change",0
" Every year, Sept. marks the anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima. Most people would agree that is the closest we've come to nuclear war since the end of World War II. This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. One of the most common reasons people might not think of the Hiroshima bombing is that it's not popular.",0
" The basic plot is about a man who arrives at an alien space station with ""destined"" passengers. From there he encounters the crew of a spacecraft near the station, and then the ship itself falls prey to the station's mysterious abilities. In classic MST3K fashion, the story is built around the distorted rants of the crew, who may or may not be",0
" So, I figured the movie would be more or less a riff on ""Rocketship X-M"", but I gotta tell you, this movie is EVERYTHING else about this crap. Because the story is uninteresting yet the plot is basically a one-sheet to the core. The plot is that they steal a spaceship and crash into the earth and the main character dies",0
" The generic horror flick has a happy disaster that's ripped from the headlines, then proceeds to throw in a few random scenes; the result is a frangipani-like flight path through some space rocks, and an over-the-hill actor who's trying to get his girlfriend to return home to his family. I'm glad the movie got cut from the theatrical release",0
" When me and my GF went to see this film, we didn't know what to expect, however she assured me that it had good reviews. So I went along with it. We got into the cinema and bought tickets and went into the screen. After a while of sitting there waiting for the film to start no one else walked through the door. I was very suspicious as",0
" The storyline is fine, but the execution is horrible. The movie draws you in right from the beginning with a new alien spacecraft, which has been activated by the aliens. While the aliens have been friendly to humankind, a race of space agitators has taken of all the natives and has de-evolved them into a new breed of telepaths. The aliens are",0
" The basic story of the story played out in the movie is how this little girl, Hanako, was pulled into the life of a millionaire after being taken in by a bizarre phone call. As fate would have it, she's unaware that the man she is being taken with isn't her true guardian, but a man she's found in the form of a gray alien,",0
" This film is an entertaining comedy about a man who is going to space to prove he can do things that are impossible. I'm sure this movie will probably have some tiring jokes and some references and references to pop culture, but it's decent as something to watch to have a laugh. Michael J Fox has a nice supporting role of which the emotional development of the main character",0
" Very entertaining at times, but at times reaches a point where the film becomes too personal. Riveting at times, a little too personal at times, but a tad too personal to tell the story we want to. A story revolving around a man whose wife has recently died, and a stranger who seems to have a sense of humor, and the little girl who doesn't",0
" When I first heard how this film was coming out, I was glad that it was coming out the first summer in an attempt to increase the box office, I was like what they say kids, don't forget about the box office, that's what keeps you going. So, I was excited to see this film when it was released, I saw it in the theater and",0
 This movie disappointed me. The premise is a serial killer in the back-ground. This could easily be the most exciting and exciting horror film of the year. But this film is so completely horrible that it's hard to be excited for it. The film focuses on a serial killer named Bob. He is a serial killer. He is a killer. He is trying to stop,0
" When I was in the middle of the filming for a project in my UK college, I called a friend of mine, and told him I was leaving the country to get back into the business. I didn't particularly want to quit my job at a big firm, but I was certainly going to do what I felt I had to do. When I got off the phone,",0
" When I saw this film, I was immediately put in to a mental state of loss. While the movie is technically one of the greatest propaganda films of all time, it is a bit unfocused and not very well presented. As a result, I felt so lost as to just not have the ability to enjoy it. I also found the young woman (Linda Carter) to",0
 I was watching this film in the theater with my girlfriend. It's one of those movies that feels fresh and new whenever you see it. I was hoping that this movie would be a good movie. It's never a bad movie when it's good. I completely underestimated it. I didn't expect much at all but it was... good. I'm not gonna go into,0
" This is one of those films that had me staying up all night long, and I'm not even sure if they fixed the film riding on the train to get to work. This is an honest, accurate story about how a man murdered his family and how the police caught him and how he was tried for it. The film starts with the family having to flee the town of",0
" When I saw this, my first thought when I saw Bob and Marion was that it was about them being spoiled rich kids. Well, after a few hours of trying to get it to work I realised that it was about the rich kids who were stupid enough to take advantage of a high school student. Then I saw the way the rich kids wasted the girl's childhood and how",0
" This is a movie that I've been looking forward to seeing, but until now I've only seen it in the theater. This is a film that is visually stunning, but the performance of director James L. Brooks is somewhat unimpressive. Brooks is a master of surrealistic filmmaking and he's managed to pull off a few so-so films which was a bit disappointing",0
" I grew up watching this movie and I remember how the writing was so bad and the direction was so bad, especially in the opening scene. I run down the streets of Upper West Side thinking that I am a psychopath and this movie is a movie out of pity. ",0
" I came into the cinema today and I played the tickets that the front desk gave me as I was standing outside the cinema waiting to buy tickets. I was trying to pick up a friend from the bar and I noticed a couple sitting outside the cinema. I looked around and I saw them, and I remember thinking to myself, why don't they go to the cinema? I",0
" One of the more entertaining movies I saw this year was this one calling itself a thriller. A family is caught out of their home and has, the entire family, thrown it all into a big house. All of these people are being watched and keeps track of who is watching who. This is a great movie that will keep you guessing from start to finish with a stellar plot",0
" While I knew it would be an action flicks, the best part of the film was watching the crew take out the lead while the lead was disappeared so the team could capture the lead. But after the team finally get the lead, the movie just runs out of steam. Why bother with the suspense when the lead is gone? Yeah the movie is realistic, but the director",0
" This is a story-within-a-story-story-story-story. It's set in the early 1940s, when the United States is fighting the Nazis in Europe. One of the things that the movie and the writer-director do, is that they go into that at least partially in the third person narrative viewpoint, and distort the story in both the literal",0
" Haha this film is really cheesy. So I went to see it, and I really enjoyed it. I can't tell you how much I enjoyed it. It was very well directed. I liked the dialog that was used. It was very well written. I liked the way the characters interacted with each other and with the scenery. I enjoyed the plot. I liked how",0
" This film did a great job of staying away from the norm and staying true to the source of the story lived out by the up and coming film star of today, Keye L. Ballard. ""The Lost Girls"" recounts the story of two young women a prostitute named Elizabeth and a young beauty in the opposite sex called Marion. The story unfolds as Marion moves from one """,0
" Relatively for one, there is little or nothing wrong with this film. There are some really good performances and a very great script, but overall the film, while looking like it had an interesting story and some interesting characters, doesn't really have the depth it should have. The film tries to jump from situation to situation, but has no real direction to it at all.",0
" A man gets separated from his family and he is hiding out in an abandoned house. The story focuses on a strange, sinister family of a family of an insane man with the ability to walk on water. The family is also a cult and they are the only ones who know what is going on and where the person is. The man hides both in and out of the house",0
" I was really looking forwards to seeing this film when I saw it last year, but in the end I was left with a horrible feeling that I was never going to see it. The reason is that I have yet to watch it on the big screen. The character of Danny is nice, and the slapstick scenes with a boy called Brian are funny. However.. the story",0
" Now this is a film that could have been great, but that's because the wonderful horror writer David Lynch gave it to us in his mind. Except for a few scenes the film was horrible, and the rest was just to elaborate on Lynch's work. It is also a nice-to-see movie but one that I would have expected from Lynch in the past. Given",0
" This film has a nice look and feel to it, but it just make me tired of the same old thing. Still I still enjoyed just watching it no matter what it was about. It had good action scenes and decent performances. The only problem was that usually the director or writer have a good idea of what they want the audience to do and this time they didn't.",0
 Films within films I was watching the first time I saw this film. I'm trying to remember if it's a surprise film or not because it's so sad. I can't forget hating the look of the film. I certainly I'll admit that it was entertaining enough to get through it. I'm not a fan of this type of film at all. ,0
 I didn't expect to like this movie but I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe it was because of my friend's boyfriend Jerry who has been a huge horror fan since childhood. The similarities to the original are pretty obvious and the characters are also very much like the original. The director Miller and writer Roamy The movie is shot in real time as if we are watching the movie and,0
" It had to be the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Very unstylish, very colourful, very over the top with very little direction, very unusual costumes, very cheap shots and very bad actors. 1 star for that alone. ",0
A murder mystery of sorts where you are finding out the truth about a long time dead person. Obviously the motive is to avenge his family ex-girlfriends death. You can see the way they work from it. It's a pretty good movie. ,0
" After my dna test was completed, I had the chance to complete this movie. I had been really interested in the film since I heard that the director was Sam Mendes. I have never seen a more beautiful movie. The studio made a mistake by not to casting Gael García Bernal which I think detracts from the film. The film was very beautiful and I",0
" I've never been a huge fan of horror films. Usually I just don't like them. This time we watched it together. I thought the talking was great and I thought the character of Bob was a nice character. Just when you think you've made it through a whole movie, there is another one coming out with the same exact theme. ",0
" We are normally not much for horror films so I was expecting something really terrifying, which I thought it would be. I was pleasantly surprised when we watched this movie. I thought it was a bit weird and I'm not sure why I was expecting anything that wasn't. What I did like is that it had good reviews. ",0
" I saw this film at my local theatre which is usually a good place to see some sort of spy thriller. This was my first time seeing the film and I thought it looked great. I thought the first half of the film was ok, the second half was bad. I think I knew what was going to happen in the second half of the film as well. I thought",0
" If you are looking for a disturbing or chilling movie to watch, then this is it. It has some very disturbing scenes and it pulls no punches. It is horror but that's expected, even with such a positive, positive cast. ",0
" I'm not really sure why I saw this movie, but I do know that I won't be returning to this cinema again. It was completely and utterly awful. The first half of the film was decent, but the second half it actually turned out to be really bad. I have to say that Ryan Gosling was magnificent, but I'm not really sure he's a",0
 I really liked that film and if you are a fan of this film you would have to have this on DVD. If you are not a fan too see it. It is worth watching ,0

" I'm not a fan of vampire but I did enjoy this film because of the style of the style. I didn't mind the fact that a vampire was entwine with a vampire in this film, so I didn't mind seeing the fight scenes in blood. I liked the way that the movie started with Johnny after he and Marion had a day together. I liked the way",0
 I think this movie was an ingenious mix of neuroscience science and music. You can feel the science in it. It was very interesting although at the end I felt that they did not go far enough. I saw this film close to my parents wedding and we were at the church to wish her well and I know her reaction was sad. ,0
" This film is perfectly wonderful and somehow I had to add a few comments. I liked this movie right away because it deals with something that many of us,but if you like a good, complex story, you should see this film. ",0
" I really was expecting to love this film. I have heard amazing things about it and that was from people who don't have a clue about horror films, so I thought it would be a great film to watch. I wasn't what you'd expect from this genre but that was expected. It was a great fun film. So far this isn't going to be my favourite",0

" First off I have to say that I am a big fan of horror films. I think they have got it right, so I am sad that I am not a big fan of this movie.I enjoyed it a lot. That being said the film, although very disturbing, was not horrible.I don't like to get too into the film, but I liked what it",0
 I went and saw this with my girlfriend on a date. We had a good dinner and by the time we were going to go to bed I was starting to become quite excited. I was not disappointed when we got to the film. I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed this film. It was well made and the acting was very good. ,0
" It is a total disaster. I was thrown out of it at the very beginning. What was supposed to be a slow building up was defaced into what I would now describe as a really bad blend of comedy, horror and shock. ",0
" This movie was so bad, that it didn't even entertain me. I watched it when it was on at least 3 different times in a row, and couldn't even stand to see the credits. This movie made me sick, and couldn't believe that someone would make another one of their scams in this manner. These types of movies are what makes me sick. They make",0
" Trouble in paradise. A movie that had a great idea, but totally got away from it. I don't know if it's a good movie or a bad movie, but it wasn't worth the $3.50 which I paid. It's just a waste of money. ",0
 Here are a special few pictures of this DVD to suggest that it's worth the extra few bucks for the $7.99 you can get for the extra pictures. ,0
" Worth a watch for turns out this movie had some great ideas and was a lot of fun. Maybe not for all people. But for those who appreciate the kind of fun that made it, this was enjoyable. ",0
" I loved this movie. The movie is about a world where people are immune to technology, and where people can be turned into vampires. I think that this casting of Lynne Ramsay gives this movie a great deal of suspense. ",0
 I was just drawn to this movie. What a great movie with a great cast who portrayed a great crime thriller. I really enjoyed the movie. Just wish there was some actual suspense to the film instead of all the screaming and swearing that was done in the film. ,0
 I have to tell you this is a fantastic movie. I laughed the entire time and I was shocked by all the twists and turns. The performances by both Bob and Marion were wonderful. I laughed a lot and shed a few tears. I thought the ending was so funny. ,0
" I hate to see the world, but don't take anyone who has a big family, or who is a family member or a friend seriously if they have a lot of money and can afford to go to college and buy the world's most expensive ticket. ",0
" I heard about this movie on the TV show LAKE SHORE about Bob and Marion. It was funny, but also sad. Bob and Marion lived life to the fullest until one fateful day. They made the best of their life, but it was not enough. Jeff Bridges, the star of the movie, was the star of the show. I think he played the role",0
" The movie was OK, but I think that the plot may have been a little too clever at the time. It would've been better if it had just become a bit more logical.
