 One of the worst movies ever made! One of the worst scripts ever made. Too much pseudo-science and not enough sci-fi. It spends too much time trying to be a drama and not enough time having humans from a rocket ship interacting with aliens and having fun. I'd rather have seen the aliens kick some human ass! ,0
" Rocketship X-M is a fairly entertaining sci-fi film from the early days of the genre. It's not great, but it's not terrible, either. It's certainly worth a viewing. The special effects aren't the best, but are certainly not the worst I've seen. In fact, they're still quite impressive, considering the age of this film.",0
" This movie is so bad I can't believe it was made so long ago. I can't believe Hollywood felt it was good enough to release as a feature. It's really bad and I wouldn't recommend it to anybody. Watch the MST3K version instead. It's funny, I like the MST3K version because it makes fun of the bad acting,",0
" There is a wealth of material in ""Rocketship X-M"" to make fun of. The sets, the costumes (especially the women's), the people, the dialog, the story. It's all so bad it's good, and it's completely entertaining. Add a little more for the host segments on MST3K.<br /><br />It",0
 There are many worse films out there but this one I found very entertaining because it's so bad. The story is bad and the effects are worse. I've seen better effects in YouTube videos. I found the only easy thing to watch was the cast. The acting is so bad you can't watch it and not laugh. I didn't like the direction and editing. It,0
" ""The Crawling Eye"" has a clear inspiration: ""The Thing from Another World"" (1951). It also has its own (fairly preposterous) history as a piece of European think-tank science fiction. (This film was created under the working title ""Age of the Ants,"" which is more than a little funny.) This is a cool,",0
 I can't put this movie into words. It's just so bad. I am truly perplexed by how something this bad is even made. The plot mainly follows a few astronauts who are the last survivors after their rocket ship crashes on another planet. The planet is populated by almost entirely by women. The men are apparently the only survivors of some disease that the men of the,0
" To call ""Rocketship X-M"" a science fiction classic is due more to its release date (1950), its savvy ability to capitalize on the publicity for ""Destination Moon"", and the appearance of actors who would later star in television as Sea Hunt's Mike Nelson, Rockford's dad and Wyatt Earp.<br /><br />The movie itself is bad",0
" This is one of the worst movies ever made. I laughed so hard at this movie I almost wet myself. The black & white effects were hilarious, but that's the only reason for it's one star rating. The rest of the movie was just plain stupid. The idea of going to Mars was ridiculous. The spaceships should have been able to detect each other, and",0
" This is the worst movie I have seen in a while, and I've seen ""Food of the Gods"" and ""The Haunting,"" ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", ""Pocket Ninjas"", and ""Basket Case"". The plot is ridiculous, the acting is terrible, the dialog is painful, and the special effects are laughable.



One of the biggest",0
" This is one of those movies that can be seen as a classic, a bad movie or a good bad movie. Some classic movies are purposely bad -- ""Plan 9 From Outer Space,"" for example -- while others are actually good movies that get a bad rap. ""Rocketship X-M"" falls into the latter category, and I would argue that it is actually a",0
" A lot of people didn't like this film. But I liked it. It was different and futuristic. I liked the ending and thought that it was not as bad as some of the other reviewers said it was. I also recognized one of the bad guys at the end. He played Johnny in the movie ""Red River"" and I had him in my English class in high",0
" Please ignore the other recent review. The movie is very true to the book. They did change some things to make them more acceptable to the audience to appeal to the movie going public. One example is that the Russian's line of people is considerably larger, and there are more guns. James Dean and Chaplin are added to the cast to help draw in more viewers. The",0
" I was looking forward to this one. Somebody was selling his vhs tape advertised as ""the original version."" I wanted to see what really bad B-movies looked like back in the fifties. I was disappointed. It is truly a bad film, but not as bad as expected. Still, I wouldn't rent it again. Compare it to a really bad",0
" I enjoyed the start, it had a nice thriller like vibe. But as the movie went on, I got a bit annoyed. The idea of the film was good, but the way it was executed was not that great. The acting was bad, and the dialogue was just plain silly. I did enjoy the end scene though, where Columbus and the ""aliens"" were",0
" The film was made on a shoestring budget to ride the coattails of the Destination Moon movie. Unfortunately it was made just a little bit too soon after the moon movie. It's not a bad movie, but certainly a little bit hokey. The script is somewhat weak, but the scenes on the space ship are a bit exciting. This is one of",0
" The background score of this movie is the best I've ever heard in an '50s sci-fi movie. It's like the soundtrack came straight out of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". The movie starts off with a prologue on an alien planet. The background music plays while the camera pans over the landscape. The music is very spacey and foreboding.",0
 I think the movie is so funny because of the plot. I don't even need to say what the plot is. The title says it all. And it's funny cause one of the rockets? Is a spaceship. And the other is a rocket. And they are in a race with each other. And the spaceship almost gets blown up. And it has a lot of,0
" The only thing worse than being blasted into space by some drunk big-headed aliens is watching this movie. Best part is when one of the crew members says to the captain ""looks like we are going to die on the way to the stars"". I thought that was very funny. ",0
" I wanted to like this film. Tried to watch it. Kept watching. But the acting was so bad that it was impossible to enjoy the film. ""Red Planet Mars"" is my favourite sci fi film. ""Rocketship X-M"" is a stinker. ",0
" A couple of years before ""Star Trek"", this was the first time I'd run into the concept of a ""time vault"" ... that is, a place where people were sent when their time was up, and they were frozen until scientists could find some way to return them to life.<br /><br />Although I'd seen many movies with time travel themes, this",0
" I love this movie. I'm not sure why. I mean, it's a bit campy. And it's rather silly. And it's not really science fiction, more of a science fantasy. (As an aside, this movie has nothing to do with the so-called ""Forbidden Planet"" movie. That one was released several years earlier and actually had science",0
" I know this movie has a following, but I don't know why. It has no action, no suspense, no sizzle, no excitement, and no fun. The story is as predictable as can be. The characters are flat and uninteresting. ",0
" This is a terrible movie. This batch of ""The Hills Have Eyes"" folks couldn't act their way out of a paper bag. Plus the script is so bad it makes you think it was rushed into production so they could sell it as a double feature with ""The Hills Have Eyes"". The plot is ridiculous (not even worth mentioning here), the special effects are terrible and",0
" The movie ""Timeline"" is a good sci-fi movie. The movie has a good plot and good characters. The only thing that I didn't like about the movie was the ending. It was too quick and I think they could have done a better ending. I am a huge sci-fi fan so I really enjoyed the movie ""Timeline"".<br />",0
" This is a VERY good production. The songs are great, the acting and direction is top notch, and the story is quite engaging. I would have given it five stars except for the fact that the DVD quality is very poor. The image is grainy, and it seems like it was not remastered well. There are some extra features, but they are very short.",0
" This is a pretty good movie, but it is not the last movie of ""Rock Hudson"". ",0
" ""The Gauntlet"" isn't a bad flick. It was written by Dan O'Bannon, who wrote ""Alien"". I hoped to see a car chase through a futuristic city at some point during the movie, but there wasn't one. I was a little surprised at the shortness, but it didn't seem to matter. I'm guessing this movie was probably not",0
" ""The Ant Bully"" is a good movie that most kids will enjoy. Its message is that revenge is wrong and sometimes we should give people a second chance. The movie stars Lucas Till as Lucas Nickle, a likable and intelligent young boy who's constantly getting into trouble. He and his father move from Florida to Arizona, where his father is able to set up",0
 This cartoon was funny as hell. It was wicked smart too. I loved how it poked a little bit of fun at the church and all of those people who just can't seem to let God die. The animation was top notch. The voice acting was excellent. The characters were all great. The story was original as well. The soundtrack was great too. It made it,0
" Marguerite Duras was a celebrated and well-respected writer in France for more than half a century. This movie is based on Duras' beautiful, poetic, and evocative novella, which is like a luscious painting that you want to hang in a place of honor. The movie is as visually captivating as the novella. It captures",0
" I was raised in a Roman Catholic, military family of ten kids. My father was a pastor, my mother a homemaker and my grandparents were the directors of the Bible Institute where I was raised. I was the fifth oldest of the nine siblings. I am in my mid-50s and I still live in my hometown. There is a lot to report about my life",0
" Starred both Robert Mitchum and Jane Russell. Mitchum was at the height of his career. He was an up and coming star in the 40's in movies such as The Story of G.I. Joe, The Unknown Man, Fallen Angel, etc. He was the ultimate in cool. He was the guy every guy wanted to be and every girl wanted to be",0
" My first negative review, I really, really disliked this film. The problem with it is that it's a western, and I don't like westerns. I don't like the way they're filmed, I don't like the way people speak, I don't like the horse riding, I don't like the ""cowboy"" look. I don't like the",0
" In 1978, one of the hottest bands in rock history released their live rendition of their greatest hits, aptly named ""The Stones in the Park"". This record was the soundtrack to the documentary of the same name. The film itself is a goofy period piece that is more silly than impressive, but the disc is a sonic blast to the past with the legendary band at their peak.",0
" I'm not sure why this movie has such a great rating, but it's not very good. I suppose it's not terrible--but not great either. It's got some good special effects--and the characters are all likeable. The story itself is pretty good. The problem is in the dialogue. It's pretty bad. And the acting--well, it's",0
" A great movie with a underated cast, it follows a group of soldiers in the Vietnam war. It follows the struggle of a sergeant who is assigned to take his unit through the heart of the enemy territory to find his lost friends and bring them back alive. The movie is a dramatic war movie with some flaws. Some of the war scenes were a little too intense and could",0
" ""Hiroshima, Mon Amour"" is often considered a movie masterpiece, but I am not impressed by it. It is basically a movie that doesn't tell a story at all, much like ""Last Year at Marienbad"". I found it confusing and difficult to watch.<br /><br />The basic premise of the movie is that Marlene, a",0
" A poor man's ""Casablanca"" filled with cliches, stilted dialogue, and a one-dimensional feel. The plot concerning the hunt for a legendary Nazi gold train is a bit of a letdown. Although the script is boring and the relationship between the main characters does not evolve, I did want to see the end to see how it was all",0
" As much as I enjoy Lee Marvin, I must admit that his participation in ""End of the Road"" didn't add much to the proceedings. I expect to see him as a tough guy, not as a soldier suffering delusions from battle fatigue. The film also suffers from having a first-time director. I am not sure whether this was the first feature of actor James Cob",0
" I don't know why this is getting such rave reviews. It's a movie about a guy who wants to be retarded and how his sister makes a documentary about it, but he's getting attention from his doctor for his acting abilities. It's done completely wrong: not funny, not touching, not thought-provoking, not anything. What a waste of time. RE",0
" This film was not very good, quite dull actually. The friend I went with said it was better than the first one but I can't see how it could be. The first one was at least funny and a bit camp, but this one was just boring. The acting wasn't that good either. The best bit was probably the bit where they had to walk in the",0
" I read lots of the reviews and get where the criticisms are coming from. I will say that I enjoyed the film, but I can see why it was maybe not as good as it could have been and why it probably won't stand the test of time. The film pretty much takes place in the present day and the setting is a desert like prison where Sean Penn is a",0
 If you see this film then you must have a lot of spare time and you must like really bad movies-FACT! ,0
" I have to agree with Bob G., the A&E Biography ""Dennis Rodman: Bad As I Wanna Be"" was a total waste of time and effort. I am sure the producers of that film would disagree with me, and I am sure A&E thought they had a good deal, but the truth is the Dennis Rodman story is nothing more",0
" Firstly I would like to say this film is a must-see. It is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. It is funny, moving and exciting. The two boys are fantastic actors and the way they portray their relationship with each other is great. The scenery is also breathtaking but the songs are a bit of a let down as they are not",0
" Even though the movie is not that good, I still enjoyed it and it was a good laugh at the end. It's a very stupid plot, with some stupid acting with some great one-liners and a wobbly camera. It's very funny and just a good laugh. ",0
" When me and my GF went to see this film, we didn't know what to expect, however she assured me that it had good reviews. So I went along with it. We got into the cinema and bought tickets and went into the screen. After a while of sitting there waiting for the film to start no one else walked through the door. I was very suspicious as",0
" This is a film that is for the fans, not for the critics. It has a great story, great acting, great direction and editing, and great music. It will make you think about life, death, and the choices we make in our lives. If you are a fan of the Matrix or The Terminator then you should see this film. This is for those who",0
" I'm going to have to say that this movie is very underrated. I mean, yeah, it's a horror ""remake"", but with it's dark atmosphere, it's just a really good horror film. And with great actors like David Duchovny, Billy Burke and especially Josh Stewart, this film is worth watching. The only negative things about the movie is",0
" So was it a good movie? No absolutely not! In fact I couldn't pay to watch it again. You see, I love Daniel Radcliffe, I love his acting in Harry Potter. He is witty and funny, and has a great sense of humour. So I thought that this would be a great movie. I was so wrong. The acting was terrible, in",0
" I was very intrigued by the premise of this movie and the cast, but when I actually saw the film in theatres I was very disappointed. While the acting was good, the story was horrible. I can't believe the woman got away with it, especially as they didn't really explain WHY she got away with it. It was so bad, we didn't finish watching",0
" A very good documentary on the making of this film. While it doesn't go into great detail, it does show just how much work went into making the film look realistic. It also shows what kind of dedication the cast and crew had to the film. I really recommend it if you are a fan of the movie and want to know more about how it was made. RE",0
" This is a story about an old man whose life was ruined by war, who has not had a successful relationship and who lives in a care home. One day he has a ""vision"" of a young girl who asks him to help her. He senses he has a job to do and he follows the clues that come to him. He realises that she has died and",0
" What a waste of money, time and effort. I had heard this film was an interesting story about someone with multiple personalities. I was expecting more than what we got. We were not even told what the story was about. Apparently, a girl who had been abused was going to tell the story of her life, but there was never any mention of this. Nor did the",0
" I bought this movie purely because it has the late, great David Bowie in it. I must say, however, that this is probably the worst movie I've seen in a long time. The acting is poor, and the plot is complete and utter CRAP. Do NOT waste your money on this piece of garbage. I remember thinking that the music in the film was actually",0
" This movie is great! I saw it tonight with my friend, and we liked it a lot. I remember seeing this movie when I was younger, and I didn't understand it a lot. I didn't understand why people would go through all of that trouble to go to the moon, just for a publicity stunt. But now, I totally understand what they were doing.",0
" I got this DVD to watch with a friend and we both turned it off after about 10 minutes of watching this crap. It is a very cliche story with nothing new or interesting in it. I don't like to comment on the acting in a film like this, as the characters are so stupid that you can't take any of it seriously, so why bother. The",0
" -I love the book and I was expecting to love the movie. I thought the casting was good except the kids. There were a couple of scenes that I thought were good. The movie was moved around a little bit and parts were changed. I think if they had left it alone and just played it straight, it would've been better. I remember some parts being better",0
" Perhaps the most ridiculous movie I have ever seen. I watched it with my GF in a cinema and was in stitches by the end of it. I would reccomend this to anyone. Just expect the ridiculousness of the film and you'll be fine. It's a film to watch when you're in the mood for a laugh, not to take seriously. RE",0
" So I watched this film with my girlfriend, we had seen the first film and went along with the second one. So we went to the cinema and waited to get in. When we got into the cinema and sat down it was just us two in the whole theatre. Now I am aware that the film was meant to be missing people because of a virus that was spreading,",0
" I went to see this movie, having been a fan of The Hills Have Eyes and The Hills Have Eyes II, I thought I could get a good scare within the first 10 minutes or so of the film, but I was wrong. The film started and there was a whole load of back story, and a seemingly strange geography behind the killers. The film jumped about all over",0
" When Inspector Sartet (Daniel Auteuil - Camille Claudel) is sent to clean up a police station in a small village called Gevrey, he finds nothing but corruption and drugs being used by the cops and also they can't seem to get rid of the crime.

" This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. I do not recommend you waste your time on this film. It has a very good cast with great acting however the story is so over done and the plot doesn't make sense. It is set in a future where machines have taken over and people are enslaved to them, but we never see these machines",0
 It's not really about the plot of the film but more about the original book by Lewis Carroll... so my take on it is that the effects were amazing but the film itself was not that good. I have read the book and have read the story so I know what the story is about. The way they have put it into a movie I think they have just made it,0
" I was invited to a premiere screening of this film in London so I obviously said yes. It was a very different experience to going to the cinema and actually paying money to watch it. It was in a very posh hotel and I had a drink before watching the film, which was nice. The film is about a young boy who goes to his first sexual experience with a",0
" This film I didn't see it when it first came out but I did hear of it. And to be frank I was never sure about this film. It now it’s interesting plot, yet I wasn't sure as it was a film about a serial killer. Then I was invited to a showing on a Sunday afternoon, I wasn't sure as I had never",0
" When I first saw the trailer for this film I thought it was going to be a highly original film and I immediately marked it to rent. However, when I got round to actually getting round to watching it, I found out that it was nothing like the originality that the trailer made it out to be. The plot was quite frankly ridiculous and it was almost a parody of",0
" Well, when I first watched this film, I was quite disappointed, the film didn't have any of the original cast and it wasn't the same story. However, this time I was very impressed. It was a decent movie, however, if you're going to watch it, watch the original not this one as this one is only for the fans of the original.",0
 Can I just start by saying that I absolutely loved the books and was so excited to see the movie adaptation. So let's begin this review... ,0
" So when I was a kid I was fascinated with these stories of these people who would go inside these houses haunted by spirits and would get the house to leave them alone. There was one story in particular that I was fascinated with and that was the story of ""The Haunting In Connecticut"". So when a film came out based on that story I had to see it. The",0
" I can't really say much about the plot except that it is the story of the young boy who is adopted by a pair of scientists who raise him to be the most dangerous of animals a human, who has no concept of right or wrong and who is then sent out to hunt the man who murdered his father. ",0
" This film was a bit of a surprise. Usually with horror films you get your usual characters, but with this one you don't, well not so much all the time, yet there are some who stand out. The victims are well played and the actors play well together to create an atmosphere that gives you the creeps. This film is a mystery with no one really knowing who",0
 This is a film that I watched whilst I was studying for my A levels. It is a story about a guy called Kevin who is a bit of a nutter who is eventually sent to live with his grandmother who he had never met. His grandmother wasn't very healthy and when he was there she died as well. In the final scene of the film he is seeing his,0
" It is a rule with me to never be impressed with a Tom Cruise film. They are usually predictable, boring and far too ""Hollywood"". So when I went and watched this film I was no different, I went to see a movie and it was not a brilliant movie, but it was entertaining. The story is about a group of guys who rob a casino and make",0
" Apparently this film is based on the book ""The Eye Of The Beholder"" by David Balducci. However they have changed the name from that to ""The Eye"" as it is a remake of the 1960's classic starring the late great Faye Dunaway. I have heard many mixed reviews about this film, which worries me being as I am a big thriller fan",0
" I sat down to watch this film and I was very excited to see it, but when the film started I was a little disappointed. The start of the film was a long build up and it did not start properly until the last few minutes of the first scene. When it did start properly it was very action packed and you could see that it could have been a great film",0
 I gave this film a go even though I wasn't sure what to expect. I decided to watch it anyway since it got average reviews. This movie is about an American guy and his girlfriend who meet on a train. She gets off before he does and he gets caught up in a mess of different situations all surrounding a woman who is half naked. One of the situations involves,0
" Could have been a decent film, but the story is so predictable and the film drags on. There is no point to the film whatsoever. It is just the same plot repeated over and over again over and over again. There is no satisfaction to the film. You see a lot of famous people in small roles, but you won't recognise them. The film would have",0
" Hilary Swank once again playing the inspirational young woman that is abused and emotionally torn apart but still manages to hold on to her dreams. I liked the movie. I was very happy with how it turned out. However, I thought that the movie became a little too preachy about telling people about this horrible crime in Asia. They didn't need to tell you so much",0

" I really like this movie. It's got the Indiana Jones vibe to it. I had never seen it before, and the plot was a little unbelievable, but its a great movie. The animation is great and the story is a lot of fun. The characters are a little shallow, but its not really a movie made for such character depth. I think it's a fun",0
" Well, I thought it was going to be ""The Sitter"" meets ""Stuck on You"" but it was SO MUCH BETTER. It didn't have the silly moments or the constant potty humour, and it had a nice little message to go along with the storyline. I really enjoy the movies that are made by Adam Sandler and his production team. They",0
 This movie was really awesome. I thought the special effects were great and it had a very good story line. It's a story of a person who is basically a slave to his master and does everything he is told to do. Will Smith does a great job in this movie. I would recommend this movie to any sci-fi fan. ,0
 This movie was an incredible surprise. Very scary. ,0
 I liked this movie. It was fun and exciting. There were some good action scenes.,0
" A fun movie, but nothing too special. I always enjoy a good horror flick, and this one delivers. The best thing about it is the plot. A small town that is suffering from an outbreak of strange, zombie-like people. The smaller town folk are turning into strange zombie people, but they don't have any control over what they do. They follow the people",0

" I rented this movie after watching the first Pirates movie, figuring it would probably be just as good. It wasn't. Very disappointing. There were no great action scenes, and the plot was lame. I was caught off guard in the beginning to see Johnny Depp play straight as an arrow. I was used to seeing him in a movie like this, with his character being",0
" The title credits do not come on until the movie is over, that is a tradition beginning with the original ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" in 1951.

I'm not",0
" This movie is a great concept, but it was just executed very poorly. The idea is that there are these people who were experimented on as children by the government and now they all have the ability to be anyone they want. This is good for anyone who is an actor or just wants to change up their look, but it's bad if someone is doing it and they don",0
 I live for psychological thrillers and this one is a must. I was shocked to find out this movie was based on a book. I cannot wait to read it. ,0
" The movie is well acted, and the story is interesting. The big problem is the inability to focus on what is important. The police seem to have no clue about what is happening, the medical staff has no clue, they can't even ID some of their patients except by their blood type. The ""villain"" is obvious almost from the start. So there are more",0
" I've seen better, but given that this is the first of two part movies, it's not too bad. The movie is a bit jumpy, and I was still confused as to why Chase's mom was working on the program, even though she works for the government, and why she would even bother with that. I'm hoping that part will be explained in the",0
" Pretty typical Action film. Entertaining. Though I did feel the need to fastforward through the final fight scene.<br /><br />Worth a watch though, despite the movie being quite predictable. ",0
" I usually can appreciate the intense violence in movies, but here it is just too much for me. I guess they also try to put a supernatural side to it, but I thought it was just ridiculous. I thought it was going to be a slasher movie. But I guess my attention span was short enough, so I didn't give it a chance. People were disappearing",0
" Terrible. Horrible. Worst movie of the year. Waste of my life and of my money. I would return my eyes to the stores if I could. Worst movie, worst actors, worst director, worst movie ever!!! You can't even call it a movie. Nothing happens, nothing changes. Nobody teaches anything. It is the same thing over and over. It",0

 This movie is a great movie. A little on the depressing side but at least it's not all predictable. I enjoyed it. ,0

" I will start out by saying that I think that this movie was a good movie. Then the problems started to appear. First off, the acting and dialog was horrible. Second off, the main character is a total idiot. And third, the ending was almost as bad as the beginning, but that is too much to say. Then I realized that the captain really is the",0

 The funniest movie ever! If you like to laugh like crazy and make fun of stupid movies then this is the movie for you. This movie is so stupid it is not even funny. But it is funny. The worst movie ever. With the stupidest plot ever. This is a must see for stoner people and ridiculous people who like to make fun of movies.,0
" This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen...the acting is so bad that it is actually funny at times. The movie is not boring but the only acting in it is horrible. The film is not scary in the slightest which is good because if it was true horror, you would puke. The film is bad, it is funny, and it is a",0
" This movie is funny, but there's nothing much better about it.",0
" I don't even know where to begin. I mean the acting was terrible, the plot was beyond ridiculous and the concept was just awful. And I thought Uwe Boll had made the worst movie of 2010 but I will have to change my mind. This movie has taking the cake for worst movie of 2010. I mean i knew it wouldn't be any good but I didn",0
" Crap like this should not be allowed. It went into the bad comedy genre. Frankly, I would rate it a 1 out of 10. You could have left me out of the movie and it would not have changed the plot. I guess that is a good thing. I waited for the movie to get to the end so that I could comment on it. Honestly",0
" Firstly I just want to say that I am a very avid fan of the Alien trilogy, and this movie is a complete disgrace to the franchise. This is clearly Aliens in name only. This movie is about as scary as ""The Nutty Professor"", except they're usually not funny. Also, the Aliens that are in this movie were very poorly done, they look nothing like",0
" I think this movie is a really good movie, but the people who say it stinks must have not seen many other movies. I mean, it is not the best movie but is really funny, and not as bad as some people say. I don't really care what people think of this movie, I think it is pretty cool. ",0
" So it's finally happened, a movie that is so bad, so horrible, just plain awful, that you have to watch it just to see if anything is worse than this. But you can't, because this movie is such a pile of crap that it deserves an award for the most bad movie ever made. (This is a review written by me. It contains spoilers",0
" uhh so i saw this movie at the theatre when it first came out. I mean it was kinda scary but you get acustomed to all the blood, guts, and gore. It's actually pretty entertaining to watch because it's fun to see the zombies fight off the living people. I personally didn't think it would be that good but when i actually saw it i",0
" I would just like to say that this movie was a major let down. I am a big fan of the war movies like Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, and many others. In this movie it was very good at first with the scene where they are being attacked at night, the gunfights, and the night patrols. But after that it just gets really boring. This",0
" I dont understand what the fuss is about.. I mean it wasnt such a bad movie. It wasnt a good movie either! The acting was just plain awful. Kristen Stewart was terrible. Frankly this girl is a joke, she is so wooden you could mistake her for a tree. I mean she is not a great actor but i dont think shes that terrible",0
" This movie sucked, I mean it was beyond terrible. The plot was horrible, the special effects were horrible, the actors were horrible. The only good thing about this movie was the blood and gore. I mean I would rather gouge my eyes out than watch it again. The original Silent Night Deadly Night is a billion times better. Oh, and did I mention it was",0
" If you like the rest of the 'Scream' movies, you shall enjoy this one. If you don't like the idea of knowing anything about the movie before going in at all, you shall not enjoy this movie. Also, if you are unaccustomed to stupid humor, you may not appreciate this movie. If you DO NOT enjoy stupid humor, you should go",0
 I DID NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE I THOUGHT IT WAS SO HORRIBLE BECAUSE IT WAS ALL AND STUPID TRASH AND IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE YOU ARE OUT OF YOUR MIND AND MORE THAN LIKELY DUMB AND I HOPE THIS MOVIE IS THE LAST MOVIE. ,0
