 I saw this a week before it came out. It was a Halloween treat for my family. The cast was great. The script was especially nice. Its what we need more of. We need more of these. ,1
" This is a movie that you know you'll enjoy but you also know it's not going to be for everyone. The film contains scenes that are highly graphic, but is also very funny as a result. There's also the usual aura of stupidity, but the film is not a mental-health film, and the jokes are usually genuinely funny. The moral message is not necessarily",1
" So, what are we to make of Carlos Romero's Syrup? Won't it be the next Ray Harryhausen? ",1
" I've seen a lot of movies that are mediocre and have absolutely no redeeming qualities, and a lot that they're great and have absolutely nothing redeeming qualities. I'm not here to say that some of the ""great"" movies in history have flaws that make them terrible. I'm just saying that a lot of them lack much in the way of redeeming qualities.",1
" This film offers the best representation of rock music in the years since the rise of the blues. The cast members of the band are uniformly great, and the whole production is streamlined and relaxed. The production design by Daniel Soldati, catering to the tastes of the times, is certainly a highlight. Rock is still the movement of the times, and if you've never seen it",1
" Clint Eastwood and the guy behind Vegas, a great combination, B- bad acting and a ton of stupidity. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that was so flatheaded and so nasty in the hands of the director. But then he's an actor, what's not to like?",1
" My first time with this movie occurred by chance, the same week I saw the original movie in 1957. It was released on Christmas Eve in that year. I was in the cinema going into work but hadn't driven home yet. I kept looking for my car, thinking that if it wasn't there I might as well go see it at home. I didn't find it",1
" AND THAT'S THE THING. Oh, yes. This film is essentially a sex comedy. Oh, yes indeedy. But it's not a great sex comedy. It's a great sex comedy. But it's not a great sex comedy, and the reason it IS a great sex comedy is because of the movie's unity of purpose. ",1
 Cap'n Cook? I think this movie is the greatest piece of cinema ever made. This is a masterpiece. I know this movie is for fans of James Cameron and Matt Damon. I don't care. The best movie I've seen in a long time. ,1
" The movie is a showcase for Clint Eastwood's tireless dedication to censorship, which will be on permanent display in his new film, Aronofsky's The Wrestler. The concept is cheap and cliched and makes veeeeery little sense. Even so, it is fascinating character study of Wrestling legends Atticus and Randy Savage. ",1
" Thanks to the discovery of the black humour intrinsic in the movie, I totally fell for it. I read the book and skimmed the rest. Aye, so much for science. I liked it and loved it, but it was a bit too heavy on the soap opera aspect. But is it all over for the inanity of your expensive movie? Did you have any",1
" If you're a fan of the old romantic comedy, then you're in luck here! The story revolves around the game of golf and its allure of the wealthy and their young women. The story is very much about a tenacious gamblers and a wily casino waitress. The movie is a classic of the genre. ",1
" The Power of a Woman is one of the most consistently good movies I've seen in a long time. It's got a great mix of comedy, drama, and action. It also happens to be one of the few honest-to-God, non-sex-based films ever made, based on the experience of a pair of women. That's right; the film",1
" This is just another movie of the week. On my list of a few films to watch this week, this is one of those I don't pick up on the first take, but watch back to back really well. The movie is directed by Gerri E. Thomas and is basically about a man who, being a man, has to grow up. His mother is the",1
" This film is sooo much fun! It's a story about two brothers who are just trying to figure out how they can get away from the family business. They end up in a brothel and the brothel somehow allows them to stay there all the way home. Well, they get their sweethearts there and the scene begins. (And if you haven't seen",1
" I've been a fan of Australian director Kerry Black's work for a number of years, and he was definitely doing his best work then and continuing to do so today. If this is the early 2000's Black festival? Just as good. ",1
" If you have seen The Yemassee, or The Pony Express, or even The Night of the Hunter (a fine film ), you might like this flick. However, I have seen these films several times before and felt like I was fooling myself if I thought this flick was going to be any good. I thought that the film was so utterly vapid, I",1
" Well, that's what I think, anyway. The man's so busy being a crook that RKO also managed to seek out the man who led the Chinese revolution. This movie had no political value, and I'm not sure that it's even possible to do justice to its list of talented actors.<br /><br />But what I find most impressive is that",1
" One never knows where to start a review. It would be hard to start without saying that I'm a huge fan of this film, and that I think the movie is brilliant. It's a good story, but it also relies on you to be a good viewer, and not just think of every scene before you were to see it again (although you won't know if",1
" Set in a small town in Nebraska, this is a ""Wes Anderson"" film that quickly and effortlessly defies everything that is considered cinematic history, the very thing its creator has paradoxically been attempting to prove in the first place. The film's most interesting and powerful moments come when it crosses into the realm of surrealism, infinite optimism and free will. In this,",1
" I just absolutely LOVE THE MOVIE ""The Ring"" (1953)... It's a very unusual film. It's a very excellent film. It has amazing sets... great colors... great locations... and good performances from John Mills, Jack Palance, and Ted Knight.... It's a hard core picture... but it's one I'm in love with.... ",1
" I'm a huge fan of David Hedison, and the movie that he directed: The Dog Who Came Back will always be one of my favorites. What could be more appropriate than to watch a movie that takes itself so seriously... a movie that takes itself so seriously...? ",1
" I saw this movie on a Saturday afternoon in the theater and I liked it so much that I had to go see it again the following Saturday.<br /><br />And even though I thought I understood the film by heart from the very start, and though I possibly might have been influenced by the fact that the story was written by Charles Burnett (who wrote the script for",1
" I have seen this film LITTLE more lately than ever, coincidentally during the day I am writing this review. I was a bit disappointed that it was not a group-based movie... A society-operate movie... But it's kind of a good fun movie too. I liked and loved the main character, Vinnie Baker, early on in the film.",1
" I can't recall the last time I saw a film so loaded with a lot of extraneous, unnecessary things. I can't watch a film and hope that it's decent. I can't even look at a normal movie and expect to enjoy it. I'd rather see a film than watch a movie I don't enjoy. Besides, consider this: after watching this film",1
" I'm not sure what the hell is going on here. Just a movie that needed a little more work than the acting, directing and cinematography in this one. ",1
" Well, it's Christmas time and my wife's been wanting me to make a review for her Christmas gift. Well, it's time! Christmas came early for me this year. As a Steven Spielberg fan and a fan of True Romance I was looking forward to a Christmas movie about a man who's been in love with a woman for ten years. I thought this would be",1
" This movie stars Susan Sarandon and was released in 1955. I've seen the video several times, but it seems there are no analogs in the USA. There's no music, no sound effects. It's just a picture. I've been on the fence about this movie. I always thought it was a commercial stinker. It didn't hold my attention and I",1
" This story involved the two main characters (Matt and Luke) having to work together to get a ranch out of the grime and mud of a working out camp. The camp itself looks like a lot of other places, have a few drawers full of papers with low-contrasts and a bank vault with a few backup notes missing. The story is simple enough,",1
" When I'm not making movies I enjoy critiquing people's opinions about movies. Here's the result: A review by a friend that was published in this magazine, ""Retro Review."" Nylon, June 1983 ""I don't play it and I hate it, just like a mate of mine that is also not a big fan. I thought it was corny",1

 I have seen this movie and even though I kind of knew who the killer was from the beginning I still liked watching it. I would recommend it to other people. It comes on Lifetime movie network quite a lot. And I am thinking since it's close to Halloween they might play it more. So please be on the look out for it if you are interested in watching it,1
 I know that I have the same thing here as many of you that are out there. I saw this movie about seven years ago and one reason I saw it was that the movie was being shown on TV and there was a track record of bad films on TV and the only reason I saw this was that it was on a channel that my husband and I used to watch almost,1
 This is a very predictable and predictable film. The movie starts off with a very neat opening... Except the plot twist. Well there was a twist in the film before that. But what that twist was I don't know... But I am certain that the twist is present. ,1
" I don't know how anyone could go wrong watching this movie. I don't know if it's good or bad in any way, but at least it's not 'straight up' porn. If you like young teenaged boys playing with sex toys, you may enjoy this movie. As for me, I just love the costumes. And the sexy madness. ",1
" This was made in 1981, and was a co-production between Fox and MGM. It stars the late John Schlesinger, who he passed to his daughter, Jennifer, in the early '90s. Jennifer was nominated for an Oscar the following year for her role in ""Miami Vice."" A few months before this movie was released, a young actor took the full weight",1
" I have to say that I found this to be a pretty good movie, especially when you compare it to the following: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />",1
 I saw this 3 times in theaters... and I have to say I'm not a big fan of this film. It's a kind of serious comedy but I have to admit I kind of liked it. Very strong Henry Rollins in front of an assortment of characters who are trying to make it in this almost Hollywood town. This was a pretty good movie and I'm glad to,1
 I've seen a few of your trailers and you seem to be very well-pious on this subject but I keep refreshing my memory of it and your trailers are just so clean looking. I have seen some of your trailers and I like the way you have a story line as the heroes begin to dig themselves a new path to success... I think you guys should do your,1
" I was super intrigued by this movie after seeing it last year's ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" I'm not sure if that's because the movie is so fresh in my mind or just because it really is a really good film... If you're going to see this film, I'd strongly recommend you watch it with your best friend because its not in",1

" It's a shame that so many American films have been so patronizing about the ability of poor white American girls to get away with their ""insecurities.""

" I have always been a sucker for Mel Gibson. But this is simply a top-notch romp. If Mel Gibson's work as a globally dangerous, lunatic law-and-order hero isn't enough, then the same can be said of his other performances. This is one of his best performances to date. It's a little off-kilter at times",1
 I know this a little bit older than the others. ,1
" I don't know anyone who has enjoyed the film more than I have, and it's a very moving and worthy visual statement. I thought the actors were great, and the performance by Keanu Reeves as the assassin was excellent. The only problem I found was that it wasn't about murder, although I may just be exaggerating my idea. ",1
" My latest film, for which I am supporting my pals David L. Adler and Matt Calhoun, is yet another post-modern take on the myth of objectivity. The main characters, played by the esteemed actors of True Grit, can't help but drink wine to their amazement because it's a dry subject that won't lend itself to argument or discussion.",1
" The first 15 minutes at ten o'clock are, like the time I went to see the ""Halloween"" movie with my girlfriend, a nightmare of a ride. It's about as scary as the movies always are, and I'm not even talking about the worst of the worst. I had to refrain from screaming excessively. It's upsetting to think that I was watching",1
" I'm not sure that I am wise to even mention this movie. The reason is the way that this short made its way into the rotation of my DVD player is that the majority of its plot is mercifully hidden from view, and in some ways the film could have been a poor version of 'High Noon' if it had not been for the strong performances of some of",1
" Despite the fact that Tod Vangoontse was, to its best-known present, a film critic, it was a film he wrote. David Lean is a busy man, with a regular schedule of job interviews, press conferences and special events, and a big ego that made him an easy mark for anyone he didn't like. He also had a big ego and",1
" One of the most fascinating episodes of the series is the one in which a young marriage union is feted by the family and society in the late fifties, not because the couple is particularly good - although it is both - but because a group of heterosexual women are, by a series of coincidences, married and live in the same small town. At the same time",1
" I never did find this movie very compelling, but I enjoyed watching it. The casting was pretty good, and the story was good. I think there's a certain bit finally happening in this movie. ",1
" This is a beautiful film that captures the essence of the Pacific Northwest's wild sides and in places is pure cinema. I wish that some of the film's subjects could have written the script that it is best suited to offer, but it was made in the best possible tradition of the genre.<br /><br />I'm one person who is very grateful to this director,",1
" This is a super looney, yet an unusually brilliant movie and story. The whole thing is too clever for its own good, yet the movie is so masterfully written that it's almost too clever. In particular John Huston's direction is excellent, in that it is so close to the material that the contrast between the two worlds is in the right balance, and it",1
" I read a review that went something like this: ""I have to admit that I liked the film, especially because it contrasted quite convincingly the poverty and greed of the Nazis and the Establishment, particularly the Jewish one, with the poverty and greed of the townsfolk. You also enjoyed the character development, especially in the first half when the film was about high school students.",1
" I thought it was a very good movie, although I'm not sure which B-movie I'd recommend it to. This movie has big stories, but I think the movie as a whole could've been better if they'd spent some time focusing on the role of the killers, instead of just one of the characters, and if the movie had been a little more complex,",1
" I haven't seen this one yet, but I noticed that it was mentioned a few times in a recent entertainment review. I've stopped watching home movies since I was a kid, but since I believe it's a good movie it should work with me at home. It's a good reminder of all the other points in my life that have been wasted or at least neglected.",1
 It's a shame that the recently-released The Devil Wears Prada has not made its way into my television and/or forgettable-to-the-point DVD collection. This movie is as powerful a movie as any of the now-three boxed sets it was released on. Not only does the picture work well as a dramatic piece of art; it's a,1
" Saw this movie with my wife and it was a spectacular experience. Let me set the scene. In 1963, the United States was a little behind the curve with regards to progress in the field of health care. That's why there was a public outcry, leading to the passage of the Health Care Act of 1963. A few years later, the Centers for Disease Control came out",1
" The only reason I am about to talk about this movie is because it's the best thing to come out of June in recent memory. Michael Radford's new film is an honest, believable, and enjoyable update of the famous Shakespearean production, which starred the late Johnny Weissmuller as the jostling Jewish-American businessman Shylock. The whole thing came",1
" I wish we'd never heard of this film. Christopher Plummer did an excellent job as the notoriously unreliable accuser. I thought he was a little too ahead-of-the-game at first but got the job done. I was also pleased with Sharon Goering as Gertrude, the blond girl who is the confidante of the prosecutor. The part was well",1
" Stephen King, the author of the hokey horror-comedy, This Is the End, had already written his most famous book in the 1980s, which would become a movie starring Vincent D'Onofrio and Jennifer Lopez. The story of a man falling for a woman who is possessed by a ghost/demon, and subsequently becoming possessed by that possessed woman.",1
" I would have to say that this isn't that bad. As the new movie of the year, in my mind it's a nice little cliché-fest. Also besides some good old fashioned heartbreak for the characters, there's a lot of angst and pain in the melodrama and it's very good. It's just not as good as the original. I wish",1
" This is a story of redemption, but it's a story so deep it can't be judged by the standard of its originality or its theatrical presentation. Here we have two men on a mission, one of them a priest and the other a criminal who's had his heart broken long enough, and who's determined to redeem himself by faking his own death to gain the",1
" This is a movie that has always had the same director as the original and composer of the film, Guy Ritchie that helped create the world of Hollywood, and Roger Ebert for whom this film can be explained. It also started as a different idea for the two lead actresses of the original movie and this one is (in my opinion) very much an attempt to create something",1
" A young woman is forced into a life on the edge of society, this time on the dark side of the ""drugs"" street, one that is extremely drug-addicted, but that's not the only thing that's going on. What the film does well is not so much the story as the manner in which it tells it. It begins with a woman who",1
" I saw this one of the best picture ever made. It's very good. A very good movie with beautiful actresses in the lead roles. It also has the whole thing going down in about 2 hours. It's fun to watch, if it don't give you any nightmares. Just go out and see it now. CLICK HERE for the best links and reviews for BLACK S",1
" Although I am still a big fan of this movie, I find it slightly tiresome, especially in terms of the gay scene. It is one of the better ""underground"" romantic comedies I've ever seen, but since it's so over the top and very sexual, I have grown to think that it is not for everyone, and not for me. I just",1
" The new movie Back to School is simply filled with a bunch of lame try-hards who can't bring themselves to be real people. The problem is that they aren't real people, either, but more like a bunch of grunts who are jumping around. As a result they find themselves being watched by a few nameless people who are also just grunts. Leave",1
 Is there anything better than watching the visually stunning rock opera from a theatre screen? as the uplifting and relaxing finale to a gritty period piece. I was all about it. ,1
" Yeah, I know this is not a very high-brow movie, and I know that most of the viewers will probably be unfamiliar with its history of the era of Death Wish or Mean Girls or Billy Elliot or these kind of movies, but if you like those kind of films you might want to see this. And if you like a hot girl first and foremost, I think",1
" I am not sure why people object so strongly to films that are so over the top. A film about a prison inmate being forced to rape a beautiful young woman seemed to work out well on HBO, but I guess it's just a matter of loading the plot with as much violence as possible. This was one of those films that just didn't work for me. It was",1
" I really enjoyed watching this film. In my opinion, I enjoyed Craig's appearance more than his acting. I thought he was very funny and interesting to watch. I think the reason this movie was such a good deal was due to the film's focus on his character. He's not a psycho, but he is a character who is very complicated. He's the sidekick",1
 The shocking reality of AIDS was practically a physical fact. It didn't take me long to find out that the film was about a man who is at his wit's end with the same thing. I have run across this movie everywhere. The only difference that it is so good I think that I have to see it again and again. <b>I would like to thank,1
" Didn't think it would be this good. I'm not generally a fan of the actor playing the lead, but that's what's happened here. There's a lot of nudity but not a ton of gore, which is a blessing in this genre. Actually, there are a lot of gore scenes, even more than you would expect from an R-rated film, and",1
" You know something's missing when you see someone you admire going through a difficult time, but you also know that there's a chance that fellow viewers may not have quite got the picture.<br /><br />But the rest of the time, looking at this film, it's clear that Ford's directorial debut is truely mediocre. If anything, it's a film",1
" Unfortunately, this film could not be put down. It wasn't long ago that I was convinced that I would never see a live-action remake of Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet, or that I would amass enough film collection to allow me to start watching the movies again. But it seems like a lifetime ago. This latest incarnation of the classic roles of these two characters,",1
" The movie opens with a literal cannon ball, an exploding bomb, two large trucks, and four people fleeing from a roadside bomb. Almost immediately, the plot follows a certain pattern. We follow the lead character, Billy (Mindy Kaling) and his two best friends, Jay (Rachel McAdams) and Dax (Jared Harris). All the while she is trying",1
" The director of this movie shot the movie in about four days, for a total of about 15 minutes. It was filmed at the El Cafe in Oyster Bay, N.Y., and the main actors did all their scenes fake, either in makeup or in the flesh. And it's all for a reason and it's not to glorify the subject matter. In fact",1
" This film is very good. It's not perfect, but it's not exactly bad, either, so it's okay. The story of Veronica makes for great entertainment. The performances are good, the direction is excellent, and the cinematography is one of the best I've seen in awhile. It's entertaining to watch, and the effects are so well-done, you",1
" When I was a kid, I was fascinated by the television show ""M*A*S*H."" I saw it many times on the screen in the late 70's and early 80's and I loved the show and the way it dealt with the Vietnam and World War II in a very realistic way. But what I liked as a kid, was the way the show",1
" I'm not very familiar with the movie, but I heard that it's one of the best, if not the best, film ever made about Elvis Presley.<br /><br />It was a very long movie to see, but it got to be pretty good by the end. Not quite as good as another movie, but certainly far from being a bad one.",1
" I have been watching this movie for a few months now, and I'm just so glad to see that it is finally released . . . It's a great movie with great actors (including Al Pacino) I've never seen before, and I've seen so many movies that were this good but that only showed one side of the character. It's not that I'm",1
" This movie is a very good picture for that time period. The cinematography is fantastic. The actors are all strong, very good, well-trained actors. The film is a little dated, but there is something to be said for this era. I don't think the cinematography is as good as Reiner's ""Casablanca"" or Spielberg's ""E.",1
" I haven't seen it yet, but I am very interested in seeing how it will be received by my friends who do. It's not very long (about two hours) and it's certainly a trial for the poor young actors. It was directed by a young director, Remy Descartes, who also directed two of my favorite Hollywood films . . . (from the",1
" I was going to write a review which might be considered (in its way) a prosaic and assertive one for the subject of this movie, which is all about teenagers and their quest for identity. But just as I was about to let the reader know that this movie is pretty much about the search for sense of personal identity, I thought I would instead make the short",1
" Actually, it's a good movie. I'm not sure why everybody who saw it felt so strongly about it. All of the actors are good and the story is interesting. But even if you've seen the picture before, it's not a very good movie. It's just not enough to make you want to return to the theater with a full-blown appreciation of the",1
" It is a must see for anyone who loves silent films and for anyone who loves games. Ristar and the Follies in Paris are the two greatest movies of silent film. And Oscar Wilde always seemed a little bit out of place in The Follies. The first movie, Ristar, is so one-dimensional that you can't take your eyes off of it",1
" This is a movie that would have made the Oscars had it not been for the fact that the cast of the film include some of the most audacious and powerful actors of our time, Richard Burton, Ron Howard, and Peter Ustinov. While that may be a bit of a letdown, it's also a wonderful achievement of filmmaking, and a wonderful companion",1
" I've been obsessed for several years with this movie, and have been waiting for the day that this became a direct-to-video franchise. It's been played on TV a couple of times, and I hope that Sony will make a theatrical version. But all I can say is that I wouldn't hesitate to see it again. The film is written by a great story",1
" I'm not sure why the studio is going to release a sequel to 'High Noon' only a few weeks after the original movie. There is just no substitute for the original, and there's simply no excuse for a sequel on the day of its release. The film was good, but not perfect. The movie has just too many flaws. I haven't even seen the",1
" What can I say? The movie is a comedy, of course. And I can't remember the last movie I saw with a funny plot AND a really good script. To tell you the truth, I found little redeeming qualities to the film, but that's not to say that there aren't. What's nice about his story, though, is that it's not",1
" People love to complain about the gross, but the greatest director of the 20TH CENTURY was a French Jewish-American. Certainly, his films were not for everyone, but he remains a very interesting character and an interesting man. I saw this film last night and, with the usual exception of a few blacks, absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the film",1
" I never really liked the silent background movies. It was hard to keep my eyes off of the camera. I've had a good memory of this one, but I can't remember ever watching it on TV. It's a very good film; it's so good that it's hard to believe that it never happened. I would expect this to be very, very good.",1
" In many ways it's like the last years of the silent film era. But in this case, the government is being forced to make a film about that era, too. The film begins where it ends. Well-intentioned, not very clever, the film is by far the least enjoyable of the silent films, and in many ways the most disappointing. Hollywood has now",1
" I was surprised by the success of this movie. I didn't think it would get to the theaters for more than a couple of weeks. Not many people had liked it, and there were some who didn't think I would like it, either. I was right to be cautious and go for the last weekend. Sunday night, I watched it with my wife. It was",1
" As a result of a serious (and painful) heart condition, it's not really the point of being in a prison where you're not allowed to see what you want to see. It's a movie about a guy who looks kindly at everyone. It's a movie about the fascinating world of American prisons and the people who have to live there. He's also an ex",1
" The truth is that I saw this on television in '56, and it felt very old to me. But this movie was excellent, and the artistry was amazing. It's clear that this was a fascinating tale, and the true romantic story is very involved. The movie is pretty (for its time) and very, very beautiful. The actors are superb, and the",1
" The screenplay for ""High Noon"" is as good as it gets. Director Michelangelo Antonioni was a brilliant filmmaker in his own right, and his credit as a genius is greatly deserved. He understands the necessity of irony and how to treat the audience's expectations to the maximum. But, too, this movie is an interesting mix. Antonioni has given us a",1
" The movie is about a young man, written and directed by the legendary Michael Radford, who writes and directs himself. The scene in which he learns to play the violin is remarkably well done (it was all improvised, but it's a deep and impressive performance). The movie is badly edited, and the music is badly acted and rendered. It's all pretty boring, with",1
" This was as much a love letter to the movie's other strong points as it was an homage to the two directors responsible for the film's creation. But it certainly didn't have the high production values of the Hammer years. It's definitely a good film, but I wouldn't call it a classic. The young actors that appeared in the film were all over the place and",1
" This film was very interesting. The story was simple but it is a very scary movie.We also get a look at the life of an Algerian woman named Saeida who is a collector and sells interesting things to people. We also get to see the life of one of her friends and her family, who she bought a house for, who she killed and then whoever",1
 I am a big fan of young actresses and I love this movie for its beautiful costumes and the way it surprised me with the love of the young woman. It is a nice movie but it is not really a romantic movie. It is a mystery movie but I didn't mind it. I think that the movie could have been a bit better but I thought it was a nice,1
 I really liked this movie. I am a fan of Mary Roach and I thought it would be fun to see a divorce lawyer be in a comedy. Mary Roach is amazing. I laughed out loud in about every scene. I am so happy with this release. Oh HOW I APPRECIATE the kids getting to see this in theaters! I promise not to make,1
" I liked the movie. Not the best movie, but it was very good nonetheless. A lot of actors did well this movie. Laurence Fishburne he was the best actor you could expect in a holiday movie. He was so well put together. What a wonderful role he played. I liked the rest of the actors a lot too. The rest of the actors were",1
" This movie has a lot in common with that other movie called ""Double Strings."" Another lesser known movie in that other movie's style. In this movie the people backstab each other instead of going after the bad guys. The thing that adds to the movie is the music. I replayed this movie on repeat a few times. I love the music and it's really",1
" I was so excited to see this recently, I have no complaints. Ewan McGregor is fantastic as the main character (and as much as I dislike him in this movie as I dislike him in the previous two movies). I don't want to give away any spoilers, but I think that there are some scenes that could have been better edited out. Which would have made a",1
 This is one of my favorite shows on TV. If you are not familiar with it. You can watch it on Lifetime At least once a week. ,1
" I'm not sure if it's a good movie or not for some reason, but I still liked the movie. It's a bit of a dated movie but it's also very well done. The movie starts with the s/m scene, mainly the girl spends her time with the guy's father while the dad is away to work, so when she gets back to her",1
" I've been a huge fan of Jennifer Lopez. She has to be one of the most famous of the 80s. And I was so amazed at how well she played this role. I was really expecting a lot from this movie. I was expecting a big star turn and a little bit of a role-reversal, but no such luck. Really what the stars",1
 This is a good watch. If you like Riley Robinson and all the other talented actresses that are in this movie she is the one to watch. The movie has a good plot and one of the best ending ever. Even though I am not a fan of old movies especially those that are black and white you can see how this movie is a work of art here. But I,1
" I watched this movie on Lifetime recently and I think it's great. It's the most realistic movie I've ever seen. The storyline isn't too crazy, and I'm very happy because I think if people watched it and thought it was realistic they would be awesome. I think any director should know that just because it's realistic it doesn't mean that it's true.",1
" I have seen this movie every summer since it aired. I was a librarian in college and yeah, I liked it but I found it very lacking in the way that other people loved it. To be perfectly honest with you, I think the entire movie is a waste of time. I don't think that it's that bad actually. If you like movies that are """,1
" I immediately loved this movie. I had an older brother, and I watched this movie when I was 2 years old. I wanted to see this movie when I was a little older. I really enjoyed the movie. It's light hearted and funny and the characters are well rounded. I would recommend this movie. ",1
" I really enjoyed reading about the plot. It was really surprising, coming from a male perspective. ",1
" Very strange, alot of the scenes turned out to be so good! I did like the plot and the little twists. I think the audience will be caught up with the story in a new way. The story is simple; a woman is murdered and the only person who finds it's body is her boyfriend. If you like these kind of nasty scarves, I recommend to",1
" This is a fun movie and I love to watch the ""kid actors"" of this moment in time. I also like the music, the costumes and the scenery. It's very strange and psychedelic, I'm not sure if I've ever seen a more surreal kind of movie. I thought about the storyline a lot as well, but I'll let you see it for yourself",1
 I am going to let you figure out what I think about this movie. I really liked it. There's something about the movie that makes me feel good. Especially in the first ten minutes or so. I've never seen a movie in which the main character is shown to control someone else and then at the end of the movie that character is on her own and gets shot,1
 What's up with all the haunted V.I.P.s? I loved it! I did not realize there was a style for Halloween until this movie came out. It really does look like Halloween and not in a bad way but in a unique way. This movie is about two young people who become friends. The movie has a great message about loving and being loved,1
" I have seen this film and I thought it was okay. But I didn't mind much. The acting was okay, but the movie was very slow to start and it wasn't like watching a romantic comedy. The scene where Avril and Kevin kiss was meh and unnecessary. I was hoping for a bit more action, but it never happened. I think it's because",1
" I'm questioning about why I had to watch this film. I have seen the trailer and thought it was okay. We were watching a loose, not condusive with a very well-done celebration of everything that is modern. The acting, now I must mention it was superb. Very likeable characters and very socializing scenes and a very good plot. But what I didn",1
" I like it a lot. The movie is about a man who found it difficult to live without his wife, and it makes the world a better place. His wife was born with a name forbidden to mankind, she was happy being with him, but a year after the birth of their daughter, the baby was sick. She went to the hospital and they tried to treat her",1
" I've seen it around a dozen times now, but this is the first I've seen the film. The whole thing has a lot of heart, the kind of heart that needs to be given some bloodless treatment. It has a case of ""Be careful what you wish for"". Though there are plenty of good musical numbers, the film seems to be about one man's",1
" I was initially attracted to the film when I saw the trailer. It had a nice romance and the love interest was beautiful. The only thing I could see wrong with it was the concept of the film. I don't agree with the premise of the film, but I thought it was a good start. The film is full of good performances, and sweet, sweet moments.",1
 I would have liked to see a little more of the real people rather than the only source material of an all-star cast. I think it would have been a better show if it was as well done as the rest of the film. ,1
" There is just something about this actor that makes him so appealing for his character in this film. He is so completely in character, he makes his character completely relatable. His dialogue is better than most actors's, his acting is better than most actors's, his scenes with Michael Caine are better than most scenes with Michael Caine, his character has a more human portrayal",1
" The only thing worse than having the director/writer/star of a film decide to make a one-time tryst after a film has been made is to keep doing it. The people who forced a two-week delay to the theatrical release of ""Shakespeare in Love"" have learned their lesson. It has to be bigger, better, and more expensive to make a",1
" That was a good movie. The movie is a little long. It is entertaining. Although the movie is a little long, it is entertaining. It is action-packed and suspenseful. It has some good laughs. THE PHILIPPINES ",1
" When I saw this film, I thought I only saw movie clips. I don't remember what I thought of the acting or the directing, though I do recall that both were believable. However, the film is a mosaic of a number of different and interesting characters. At the beginning of his career as a musical comedy actor, Cora Jean Blythe was a very convincing",1
" Wow . . . I was almost surprised. Wasn't that a shame there were not more films about this type of historical event? It's a neat story, pretty well shot, and a pretty good picture. They really did an excellent job. ",1
" It is the best movie on acting I have ever seen. All the artists are old Turkish theater actors, they are magnificent in this movie. It is sometimes said that ""They do not act, they live it,"" you can really see this in this movie. The director is also competent, you cannot see lots of moving cameras around but the positions of the cameras are also good",1
" A fool is a fool is an attempt to depict a foolish person. That has to be made plain, and obviously, that is not the place to do it. The problem in this case is that the fool he's speaking to is someone else, not the person the fool is talking to. It is like opening a booby-trapped box, where the contents are",1
" A good movie, with lots of size ",1
" I love this movie, I really did. Not only is it dark and twisted, but it is also violent and cruel at the same time. There is also lots of wonderful, real-life drama, which you don't see in a lot of films. ",1
" I enjoyed the film and most of the actors. Their appeal as I'm sure everyone can tell from looking at the above pictures is really, really big. But it is a story so big that it needs a short to up the ante. I did enjoy the film, but watching the actors give it up so easily seems a little too easy for them. You can tell that",1
"



This is a film that touches on some very sensitive issues. In an effort to goad the United States into war, our evil, greedy, profligate emperors summon a man, Rabbi Akiva, to the king's court. The king orders that the rabbi be murdered . . . with the full knowledge of all courtiers. But when Akiva",1
" I never watch the movie ""Funny Face"" because it is too sad, but when i saw this director's short film ""I am LeMercier"" i instantly fell in love with it. Since i lost my husband in 2010, i read about other man going through the same thing. I got to watch this short film and i fell in love with it. I",1
 It would be since I've seen this movie that I have ever been so happy. But that is not the case. The great thing about this movie is that it is not about the great Shylock who suffered and died under the heel of the Jewish enemy. The film is about the man who left his home and his birth parents and who turns to the Jews as a,1
" This is a really good production. I did not use to be so into it. The story is about a guy named Vinny. He left his family to follow his dreams. He goes through life wanting to be close to his friends. But life is not fair, because when you are rich, you will always want to be close to your friends. So Vinny gets",1
" Mulder and Scully are great. Of course they are awesome. The times they are a-changin' and Scully's English accent is just amazing. The Coenz Brothers are great for the first time they have done a theme song, I know that the music is a little cheesy but it quite a lot of fun to listen to it. Its a shame that this",1
" The best film I have ever seen, I recommend to everybody. I was so disappointed when I saw that the director was so arrogant and pretentious that he thought his movie was as good as any of the other movies he made. He had to charm me by telling me that his movie was better than all the other movies I saw. I found that funny, and it also",1
" Good sirs and august ladies. I'm not sure why the director chose to cast John Ritter as the villain in a mystery film set in a mansion. Granted, Ritter looks like he could be a little more wriggly in the puzzles he's putting together, but I like the concept of the mansion and I'm a huge fan of Ritter's work",1
" One thing that has always annoyed me about ""Harry Potter"" is all the jokes that they took from ""The Lord of the Rings"" (and I think even from ""Harry Potter""), the films use of fantasy and rightness thinking, it is just ""irrelevant"" to the point that I can't stand it. I suppose it's really fun to think that you can",1
" I was just happy that the camera crew changed rooms from the set to the bedroom. First of all, the final, intense scene with Kelly Costello and Marius Caen was very cool, especially because it was filmed in a bedroom! I liked the ending, although it was a little underwhelming.<br /><br />What was more interesting though was some of the",1
" The flick was a real low point for me the entire time I saw it, it was just so bad. I don't think it can ever get a rating because it's so bad, especially since the film is so short. I did laugh a lot but when I saw the closing credits and saw the name of the actor that played the part of the sailor , I didn",1
" Peter Jackson's greatest wonderland. The film focuses on the character of the Shadow King of Gamearth , a half-vampire, half-human half-vampire, and a wizard in the hold in his castle. The evil lord of the castle has a secret weapon: his eldest son, a very beautiful girl named, Avril (Brie Larson). In the",1
" I think it's because they're all so hot and sexy. It's fun to watch, especially the little scene in the forest where they go on their honeymoon. Not to mention the great lines like "" your head is too small for my cock"". The lighting (especially the sun) is phenomenal, and the storm scene was awesome. ",1
 The show was very funny. I liked that it had a serious depiction of father-son relationships. THE CUTS are all so effective. I was glad they did the scene with the movie star's girlfriends in the finale in the movie. I also liked the way it was shot. I thought it was a good scene to finish with the shipwreck. I thought the,1
" The remake is even better looking than the original, including gorgeous new sets and costumes, new locations and a wonderful score. Ozzy Osbourne has gone from the Beast from the East to a bigger role! Grianne Stiles has become one of my favorite actresses ever. I really liked her in the original, and I think she is one of the best performers around.",1
" I really liked this movie as the ""intellectual"" character played by David Spade is not so dumb and silly after all. So many mature movie actors would have been better for him as he was too serious for the character. The girl who plays the cop is nice too, who's really cute. The girl in the boat is fun. I would like to see a",1
" So I was watching the second season of The Sopranos during my work at the time, and I saw a man lying on the ground in front of the house.<br /><br />I also saw a girl watching the same guy.<br /><br />He was restrained (to get his legs off the ground) and I think she was watching from behind.<",1
" So, in a universe (other than our own) where only large dogfish and the occasional shark swim around in the shark harbor, but its totally cool that a bunch of surfers were out and about, going down the beach for a little exercise, surfing, and making some silly music. ",1
" It's an odd film to watch if you're a die-hard fan of the film because of the way it tries to do too much. They make the character of the club owner seem to be a bit of a jerk. Also, it's not really a movie to watch when you're not into the whole idea of S/m. Its just a silly movie that",1
" I did not like it. The men in it were very hot, it was a good comedy, but I don't like jokes about women that are only bought for the men, and I found all the jokes painful. ",1
" Usually I have to review a darker movie to get into it, and I think this is No.1 for me. Am I as guilty as I think I am of liking the film? Yes. This is a film to see, and sometimes, so bad it just goes on and on like it's going to be a classic film released/released. It's just so",1
" If you haven't seen it, you will be very disappointed.<br /><br />I have to say, there were a few scenes that I was a bit disappointed by. One was where they had a cat on the boat, which I thought was just going to be some really cheesy expression, but after awhile I realized that it was in character. The rest were really",1
" What a waste of screen time. It seemed to be the aenam of the school and kid and save the kids that. It was like a terrible waste of our time. It made me nervous to watch it. The movie was well shot , with fantastic lighting that probably would have been better if cambrian scuba diving hadn't been involved. The plot of the",1
 I would like to see her husband and kids faster . But I have to say with her husband she was the best performer . His character was just so flawed I could have cared less about him and his religion and why he married her. I couldn't believe what he would be like if he had never married her. I wish she had written a part for her daughter she just,1
" I think the reels of the cinema were too simpleto be effective. I also disliked the lack of budget to have a theatre screening with a 60s theme, see a movie and then go home and not watch the movie because it is too boring. ",1
" This is something I am going to look forward to more. I think it is a must see film. The script is great and the acting is superb. I am a sucker for cheese. But this film was mindblowingly funny. Should you see this film, get a copy from your local video store!<br /><br />I skipped around the first half<",1
 I think I would be totally surprised if this show don't get a run out of the top 5. This show was perfectly shot and made me wonder why this guys character had to be a dick to everyone. You just knew that he was going to turn out to be a dick. You can't sing like anyone else on the show and you can't act like anyone else,1
" Dr. Suzuko Mimura, who made the short short film ""Cave in the Head, Part 3"" (1997) is a fixture of Japanese cinema, and this film can be seen as the latest in her career. The themes are quite obvious, but the way the film is made is also quite interesting. It is very slow-paced and it is step-",1
" I am a huge fan of this TV series. And I like the whole idea of what it's about, being a school. The way this story unfolds, its a fairy tale, i think about this show every day, even when i dont think I will ever watch it, I see the talented actors living a disgusting life... A life of degradation, that is, going",1
" This film is simply a gorgeous example of the German language. Although it is a tad slow, a bit wooden, and lacking in all the great variety of ideas and impulses of German cinema, it is still a gem and a must see for anyone who has ever been surprised by his words. The story of the so-called ""Fabian Society"" is an aspect of German",1
" I have to say that this is the best movie and I think I am not the only one... I am in the audience for this one. I like this movie for several reasons: 1) the acting. 2) the soundtrack, 3) the story. The story is also spectacular. I think we can see the last movie of the director, Saul Bass, and he",1
" I love this movie. It is a true story of a girl who was raped by her Turkish family. This is a very beautiful and moving story about a family. The movie is extremely well done. The movies I have seen so far, are not so well-done. The best part of the movie is when the father comes to pick his daughter from the house... LE",1
" This is a great movie, it is good for my childhood, i am a big fan of Peter Fonda, i think he has some great films to come(this one is probably one of the best films he ever made). ",1
" This is a great movie. I have to set my record here to say that this is the best movie I have ever seen. The cast of actors are all very talented and have a very good emotional presence. It was a great movie from beginning to end. <br /><br />John Ritter is the main character in the film, he brings a great sense of",1
" I personally think that this is a very good movie, the story is interesting and it has a more realistic result. But I am not really a fan of the title. It gives me a headache, it is very difficult to watch. I think that it is a great movie and it has made me very happy. ",1
" There is nothing wrong with a film about two old Turkish movies and it has to be seen to be believed. The original is yet to be created, but it is a very good movie. It originated in the 1970s and has to be seen to be believed. The director Anastazar Leviev is a Turkish cinema great, and the picture is great. The soundtrack is",1
" I was with my friends and they were talking about couple of movies they seen. We were talking about the Cleopatra movie, one of the best movies I think. And then I heard that they saw this movie, and I asked them about this movie and I was like it's going to be the best movie on the list. I looked at them and they were laughing",1
 I love this movie<br /><br />I have seen it a few times now and I love each time we start to live individually. ,1
" I am a big fan of this movie for so many reasons. Firstly, the entire movie is all about unconditional love, from the mother's love for her son, to the father's love for his daughter. Secondly, the actor John Ritter is absolutely hilarious, you can tell he has grown up really fast as the movie progresses. Thirdly, the movie isn't actually",1
 This review is in comparison to the two other reviews. In the first one i just wanted to say Ritter was in this movie and most of the actors. In the second review i just wanted to say that this movie is an awesome movie. Derek Fowles is make you feel like this is a life time movie. And to all the actors in the movie it is,1
" If you have been to the Turkey Center and you like to see the Turkish or Turkish-American theater, you probably will see or hear about this film.<br /><br />This film is a story about two brothers (Robert and George) who live in a boarded-up house in Istanbul. They have no money and work for a neighbor who sells cigarettes. George discovers",1
" Out of all the films I've seen in my life, this was one of the best. I don't know if it's because of the singing, the cinematography, or the acting. But it's so complicated. When the director was working, he was so talented because he could not know what to do with all the ideas, and now that he's gone,",1
" You and me and our fairies. Me and Jennifer Lawrence and Elizabeth Olsen and Sam Nunns. I got the Uka doll from my grandma, and she started walking me to school. She left the house and told me not to come back. I went to the door and she appeared in the door. She said, oh look i'm going to get you the doll",1
" I loved this movie, I am a huge fan of cinema, I love the landscapes as well as the story. And the title is a metaphor for the world. I am still really tired of it but it means a lot to me. In my opinion the biggest mistake of the movie to me is the way they played with the viewer's emotions. I was actually hoping for",1
" This film is a masterpiece, even if you have a negative view of the Turkish theater, you should see it. The story is fabulous, and it shows what a great theater an actor can be. The quality of the actors is fantastic. I recommend this to everyone who is interested in the theater (for me, it is that kind of theater). The movie also follows this",1
 One of the best movies when i was in the cinema back in the sixties in london. The performance of John Russell was amazing. ,1
" The only reason to see this film is to experience the timelessness of the story, and to marvel at the fact that the Turkish actors were able to deliver such a great performance. I loved the actors from all over the world, but especially Kaleta Ani (used for the father in this film) (Queen of the Night), and Fatma Utku Tipun (",1
" I believe that the movie that is totally fake is the one that is really fake. The two movies that we are watching are about the same, which is odd. But, there was a character who I thought was really grotesque and the man who was in the car who was a creep. This was the clown in the car. I thought I would get the impression that the",1

 It is very good again this is a very well-made film that takes a look at the 60's and it is a good piece of work that will appeal to a wide variety of people. ,1
" For those who haven't seen the film, I do recommend it, especially those who really love to read reviews. Not only does it have a very good opening and the best ending and the whole film begins quite correctly. There are a lot of interesting things going on that are not really explained at the beginning of the film.<br /><br />I have to say that",1
" I've never written, and I hardly ever read, reviews, and I don't predict the future. Now I'll do so. I regret that. I'll say this: It's a ton of fun, and a lot of fun for people who don't have Douglas Trumbull's brilliance in their history books. The long way back and forth between the fast-",1
" I've seen a lot of people complaining about the quality of this film and the opening scenes, yet it's the only one of it's kind of time. I know it's a bad review, and its the issue of people saying things but it does serve a purpose, and I like the movie. I don't really know what the drama is about? I like the",1
 This was a long time ago and I have forgotten the story. The film depicts two gay men who meet on a night-time cruise boat and go from there on. Both felt they had to be together in order to avoid some kind of sexual repression. In a way it's a film of the 60's only gay men would be so lite but it was just a,1
 Well I saw this one in the summer and obviously didn't like it... I found it kind of boring and a little creepy.<br /><br />Once again Roger Corman was in voice-over and remarked that the film was going to be released on a Saturday evening on video and I went out to the park that evening to see it and it was utterly hilarious !,1
" The film wasn't very good but there was the most part of it to be well worth seeing. The casting for the female lead was decent and a good contrast to the male lead, she was at least slightly more developed than most of the other female characters. she had a bit of a rough ride in some scenes but this was told in a very good way and you could",1
" This is the kind of film one initially selects to make up the numbers from video rental.....only to discover an under-rated entertaining and enjoyable movie!!

" This film had me coming back for more of the same all over again. It made my love for the sixties even deeper. When you see the movie a few times it is almost impossible to watch it without coming back. It is a nice if shameful film to see, but one you will watch over and over again. Michael Douglas and Paul Newman are fantastic in these films",1
" Its a shame she didn't get screen credit , she by far did the best job in the film has the girl on the cross , best part of the movie .She had much more impact than Avril , or just about anyone else in the film . She almost made S/M look like fun ! She really was believable has the S/M model that gets scared of",1
" I don't like to have my opinion but this is a great film and I think this would be a great film to see for the younger generation A lot of the film I can understand and some of the ideas it gives are original. The angsty teenagers are like a modern day Robin Thicke , but you can understand the angst that they feel in getting themselves into that",1
" The sequel to his romantic comedy, Blowup, is a big, big production with an a lot of flashes of genius: the good, the bad and the ugly. It begins like every other romantic comedy: with the good. With the romantic comedy: with the great chemistry between the two leads in R. Lee Ermey and Cristina De La Cruz. With the",1
" This was a great film. It is instantly a pop culture classic. It has all the right ingredients: beautifully shot, beautifully acted, beautifully shot again, beautifully shot again, This film is a classic. The whole film is a perfect blend of a film noir, a crime drama, a satire of S/M, and a thriller. The film has the slinky",1
" The most important aspect of this film is that it is a documentary of a filmography. It is a very well done film and very about the person behind the lens and the movie. Van Damme is an important part of that person behind the lens, and that person is an important part of the person he was behind the lens. The film is well done, the actors",1
" I watched this film in my late teens. I don't remember the cast, but I can still picture them, and I believe I must have heard them in the background. I'm a pretty vague guy but there was just something about their performance. It was their personalities, their mannerisms, their movements. I felt like I was at their little live rehearsal. To this",1
" Fantastic adventure. I caught some of the ""crimes"" and I was intrigued by the ""stories"" that came before. Too frightening really when the monster shows up at the end. But a real Jason, not just a guy in a costume. I also liked that when the camera gets caught on the monster , it was so realistic that I stayed with the film even though",1
 I saw this film from a friend who had seen it before and we had a great laugh at the same time! She said its for the youth of us and the young ones in the world that wish to challenge the status quo. When I went to see it last year and saw the film it was in a dvd format and I didn't realise that because it was a,1
" The film is yet another anthology of hard-hitting, realistic documentaries. The scope is wide ranging, even with the lineup of films that appear in the anthology, and it is a total shock to the system to find two of the same director in the same movie. ",1
" What can I say? John Ritter is such an actor that he can be a man on the road (and an actor in the film) at any point on set. In other words, he's the most handsome, intimidating man in the business if you're a George Clooney fan or a John Travolta fan. AND he's an excellent dad. This",1
" I think this is a really great film! A movie with a good style and a good cast; It is real warm and enjoyable. John Ritter, Elizabeth McGovern, Martin Sheen, Nick Nolte, Jennifer Jason Leigh and John Turturro are re-enacting a bunch of lines from the show. The movie stays true to the show for a long",1
" There were only a few years after the end of Vietnam when the public witnessed a good old-fashioned, blood sweat and tears kind of event. Tom Cruise, the great actor of his day, played a Vietnamese soldier in this documentary about the war. The documentary was shot and made by Stephen Koskoff. I had seen this documentary a couple of times, and just loved",1
" This funny little film is directed by David LaGravenese, who also co-wrote it with his friend and co-star, Robert Redford. LaGravenese's style has a sense of humor in it that can only be described as of the '70s. It's almost like seeing the stories of Doc Martin, Rat Pyo, and Spider-Man",1
" The first time I heard this movie, I was mildly moved, but then it dawned on me that this movie is about what it means to be a child. If it is a hero, a hero of a villain. If it is a child, a child of a parent, a child of the people. There is no if...there is only if. The narrative",1
" To some the movement of the American into a fascist state was already one of a kind. But what was to stay the same was the idea that America could not be allowed to become fascist. The message had two different impulses: one was that the United States must become a United States based upon the principles of the Constitution. A perspective that was echoed by most other nations, and",1

" I love this show. It's so short and it's so funny. Even if it were a 10 minute show, I could watch it over and over and over again.

" I was a bit concerned when I saw this film, as I was not a fan of the films of this period. However, after the first viewing, I was very impressed. I was expecting something new, but something so much bigger was added to this film than I could have ever imagined. The film is simply a classic example of the 20th century's obsession with the",1
" This review was written as I was watching a re-release of this classic movie. There has been a recent resurgence of interest in '80s and '90s movies from the Soviet Union. The cast was great, the soundtrack was great, but the storyline was too close to anything that could be classified as a ""classic"" movie. It was originally broadcast in March 1986",1
" Yes, the main character, Kevin, is a real person, but the filmmakers wanted to keep the spirit of Robert Altman alive.<br /><br />The series is essentially a coming-of-age tale in the vein of Wings (as the story goes, Kevin is just a guy who tries to be a man, and wants to be a star) set in",1
" Funny, charming, and engaging, this is the best of Ritter's back catalogue of films. Certainly better than the amazing but shortlived The Coldest Winter. John Ritter combines ease and grace with a devastatingly real character that we can relate to. It is a film that is, without a doubt, for anyone who has ever suffered the aching of being hurt",1

This is an excellent show with an interesting plot and the fine performances. I'll be watching it for a long time.<br /><br />The theme for years was ""the War on Terror."" The show focuses",1
" The show delivers everything a young star could desire. The plot is a bit thick at times, but there are a couple of very memorable scenes that will be remembered for a very long time. When the Green Goblin is about to be murdered, people will often scream ""Goblin! Goblin! Goblin!"" which is a good way to get the crowd on your side.<br",1

 This movie I'd say was quality but not great. One thing that really stood out about it was that there was a part of the movie where Hamlet is having a conversation with some peasants and he was forced to tell them that his mother was the one that was responsible for his father's death. I don't know WHY but I find it really amusing. I've never,1

" I was devastated when this film was released. Now, i'm not a huge fan of horror films so it was nice to see a truly frightening and frightening way to scare the pants off people.

" I get the impression that this film is a little Bohemian, although it is not socialist Soviet, it is a Socialist German Expressionist film which has its special purpose. I think the reason the film has such a special purpose is because it is highly stylized, with the camera play being the key element. The filmmakers tell us how much they admired the work of directors such",1
 One of the best films of the year and I loved it.

 This is a film in which you can clearly see even the most extreme of filmmakers at work.

" I saw this movie last night for the first time, for the first time. And I must say this is a very worthwhile film, even if the plot, though not fully developed, is quite good. I thought the cast was great. Brandon, Martin, Elizabeth, even Colin Farrell. It was a real ""I'll bet you can"" movie. Well worth seeing.",1
" Thought I would never find a film as good as this, but I was quite pleasantly surprised. The film was a huge hit with critics in Europe, where it played for approximately four hours at the Cannes Film Festival. It's at the very least a great movie to watch, and I plan upon re-watching it several times. I have never seen a film as horribly over",1
" I love this film and I love Donald Sutherland. It's more than the sum of its parts. It's a great drama about life, love, death and the way we must live our lives if we are to be human. But it's also a fascinating exercise in the use of animation to bring about a psychological effect. A supporting character explains to the main character why he",1
" As the saying goes ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"", so it is with the Wes Anderson film. It is a great film, really a great film, that needs no rehashing as it deviates in classic Wes Anderson manner. It is also one of the funniest films I have ever seen in my life. It has some charm and drama",1
" One of the best comedies I've seen in a long, long time. I've never seen anything like it but the cast is really good and the story is really good too. It's thrilling and funny, a real page-turner. Well worth seeing. ",1
" I found the play to be a little bit slow and not exactly brilliant, and I was a little upset that the play had to be ""ain't."" But okay. I saw the play and loved it. It was a nice way to spend the summer and a great way to kick-start the fall. ",1
" I saw this movie for the first time in September 2003, and did not like it. However, I saw it again about a year later, and loved it again, despite the fact that I had never heard of it before that. I am not sure if this was a fluke, but the trailer for the movie was cut in half, and the first half was about",1
" The film is very much a story of redemption. The character Hamlet ( Anthony John Colman) has been carefully selected to serve a noble role. This is the role that he is to play, but it is also the role of a character that he is to be in life. The problem is that he can't live up to his performance. The role is too important",1
" How about three hours of the greatest cinematic adventure in the history of cinema? With its incomparable characters, its incredible atmosphere, it is by far the most riveting film to come out of Hollywood in the last year or so. But I think you'll agree with me when I say that it's not a bad movie. The movie is not a big hit, but it",1
" I've been a fan of one of the most underrated comedies of all time, Groucho Marx's ""Buster Keaton Show"" (1959-1961). This movie works VERY well. Everyone needs to see this one. It is a great example of a very funny movie with a very stressful subject matter. It is a very entertaining film. There is a",1
" I4S to a large extent is a classic. I mean why not. And I've said it before and I'll say it again: there's not that many good animated movies out in the world, but when you do get to see one, you'll find it's the best! The characters are unique and the animation is stunning. I don't think I've",1
" There's something so honest about this film. Its not the plot, but the human spirit. For the first time in here, I feel I've had a chance to meet my hero, and I've really enjoyed it. This is a film that will keep me captivated for a while.<br /><br />The film itself, is a little slower than I expected",1
" If you want to talk about the future of American comedy and satire, give this film a listen. Though directed by a comic whose charm and charisma are easily rivaled by none other than Leno and Letterman, this film has a decidedly modern emphasis to its characterization, atmosphere and plot. And in its frequent reference to the early McCarthyism of the 1950's (in the",1
" This is a classic. Greeting card cards have no need for a silk purse, as they are used for much more than just small notes. The Chinese people were so poor that they didn't have to eat. They didn't even have the right clothes to wear for the new year. They only had one year in the year, so they were lucky that they had",1
" The director can't have been more attentive to the emotional triggers behind the scenes, and the cast can't have been more powerful. There is no better depiction of the myriad perils of being a politician than Ms. Kennedy-Miller. The politics in this film are deliciously funny. ",1
" The rest of the film seemed a bit boring, but it did not hold my attention long enough to be harmful. I would recommend this to those who enjoy comedies like ""3000 Miles to Graceland"" and ""The Adventures of Prine"". This film is worth seeing for the stories told. It is not all about the movies of Barry Zaleski. It's about",1
 This is a movie I could see a child reaing from the first time they saw it. It made me happy when I returned home. I was a little embarrassed that my son had never seen it. I am now celebrating that birthday.,1
" The Remorseful Animation of the World's End - BONUS DVD: This is a nice little meditation on what it means to live. Very nice. <br /><br />The film is made by the Austrian animation company Elenin. The film itself (I agree with the title, the world's end, whatever you like to call it) is well",1
" One is a man who is not like other people, who has no shame, is comfortable with himself, and is not afraid to make mistakes. He is not afraid of skin allergies, or cancer, or AIDS. He is a man who does not wait for love or marriage, and he does not have to settle for what lives and what does, and what other people think",1
 What can I say? I know this movie from start to finish. It's hilarious. It's an strong link to my past and will change the way I view film in the future. Hypothetically speaking :) The down-fall? There's no Socrates Johnson! ,1
" I've been watching Guys With Kids since it first came out on DVD in 2007. I've seen it about ten times, and every time I have been thoroughly enjoying it. I've not seen it again since then, and I haven't seen it a second time until the day I saw it again. I haven't seen it again until now. I have become addicted.",1
" Even though I've seen the movie twice, I can't say that it's the best. I personally liked it but I still have a kinda mixed feeling about it. I think it's fine but it definitely is not a masterpiece. ",1
" This movie is an absolute blast. I can't stop watching it and re-watching it in my living room. It's funny, it's smart, it's brilliant, and it's an absolute blast. One of my favorite movies of all time. I always have my popcorn in hand when Sybil comes in the door. It's a great film. I was sad",1
" Let me start by saying I was surprised to see how good this movie was. I remember when I saw the movie from the preview, I thought it was going to be a farcical, stupid, mindless, blah, blah, blah. I didn't think the movie was going to be anything special. I never thought it would live up to its potential. I was",1
" This movie is the definition of the word ""Laugh-At-the-Interior-of-the-World""! A slow burning film that is full of character development and humour. The characters are never forced to be in a waiting position, it's all very natural. I had never seen this movie before, and it was very enlightening. It was just so",1
 It's a shame about the Time Warp. I really liked it. It's a great ride that took me almost all the way through the timeline that we know. ,1
" Good movie for an all child's audience. Great story. Good characters. Good acting. I enjoyed the movie. It was a good movie, no doubt about that. The story line was interesting enough, and I could see how the characters were all different, but not too different. The film made me laugh out loud. The story line was good. It made me think",1
" OH MY GOODNESS, I LOOOVE THIS MOVIE. I went to see this movie with two friends last night and we both cried. When I first saw this movie I was not prepared for the depth of its humor. I watched it twice fast forwarding through every scene. I was laughing until I was sick! It is a testament to the depth of the human",1
" This film was directed by Arthur Lee and it was shot in Egypt. The film is a crocodile-based story that follows the journey of a man from childhood to adulthood. The crocodile has to be released from jail, but he's not ready to let go. The film follows young Darius on his journey from Egypt to Australia. The film is a story of discovery,",1
" A DOUBLE LIFE presents a potpourri of enthusiasms, emotions, and experiences, each of which seem to have its own unique voice, but all of which share the same central thrust: the need for tolerance. It's a story based on a book written by a black man, Anthony John Colman. The film is based on a novel by Bill Wood",1
" REEKEWOON!!! You can't say that enough. This movie, with its atypical story, its crude characters, its black comedy, it's Americana, it's shocker, it's kudos and deep down it's a great movie. I've only seen a few others like it, and it doens't even begin to compare to",1
" This was my first gross-out experience in film, and I regret it. I can't really say why I grew to love the films of Peter Bogdanovich (you can read my review of his seminal film ""A Day in the Life"" in our recently updated ""A Very Delicate Subject"" section), but it has something to do with Paul Schrader, the",1
" I try to avoid these types of films because I always end up getting a bit bored and unhappy during the first portion of the movie. But this is no exception. I'm always disappointed when I realize that despite the hype, the film is simply not going to entertain me. Then, too bad, because this movie is so good, it's a definite must see. It",1
" This was a wonderful exercise in editing. It is a very entertaining movie to watch, especially on TV, but one is so distracted by the theatricality of the film that the story itself is no more than a brief diversion. I was very impressed by the apparently low budget of the film, and by how smoothly the film was handled. What a great job by the director,",1
" I was pleasantly surprised to see John Turturro in one of the final scenes of the opening act of Retropolis. He plays the role of a former union boss going through a lot, who eventually becomes a very nice and powerful man in the union. Against all odds, he is able to secure a new job at a company where he's a legend. Turt",1
" Why it is necessary that I see this movie prior to my first viewing of the upcoming Independence Day film is a problem for me, since I already know the answer to that question. If I watched Independence Day with John Barry on the big screen, I would have been in the dark about the fact that the film was almost exactly the same idea that has been used as a plot",1
" A DOUBLE LIFE will blow you away with its unique blend of comedy, action, and a strong sense of drama. There is a realistic portrayal of an actor's life which, as a seasoned professional, can make even the most jaded viewer, jump out of their seat. With Ben Affleck as the blazer, I was more than a bit taken by the",1
" As the first trailer for the film revealed, it is a very different child's film. It's about two orphans, one of whom falls foul of the institutional system and is executed by an American army officer. There aren't any sex scenes, no kissing, no singing, no dancing, no wild music, no rock'n'roll or dancing. It's the story",1
" Castaway is a tale of two things, and a plotline inspired by the two stories of the past. Like Rob Reiner's The Bushier the Tree, John Boorman's fish out of water story is told from the point of view of the man who lives on the island. ",1
 A double life has developed a mystique among film fans for two reasons: the plot idea of an actor getting so wrapped up in a role (here Othello) as to pick up the great flaw of that character and put it into his life; and that this is the film that won Ronald Colman the Academy Award (as well as the Golden Globe) as best,1
" Portia De Rossi, the solid actress in Let's Make Love, has chosen to make her film debut here in the form of a bombshell who is also a sex symbol, but in her own right, not as the victim of the male gaze. The director, Chris Carter, handles the script to his full advantage and, as with many other things in this movie, he",1
" If you've got a family, or at least one spouse and a girlfriend or lover, you might be wondering why you have this movie. Well, could you possibly do a family fest without putting the film in the family? Of course not. This is a magnum opus in which the director squeezes every last drop of time possible. It is an '80s",1
" Phoebe Walleran, it seems, is a fiercely determined child. I know it's not the norm in Hollywood but it sure is in this movie. Phoebe Walleran, in her role of the ever unrelenting, and ultimately vain, frustrated, and reclusive, secretary Margaret Thatcher, has earned her place in history with her tiresome attitude.",1
" Funny enough enough, I read on IMDb that Randall Miller had signed on to direct a remake of the Rob Reiner film based on the 1986 Stephen King novel of the same name. I wanted to see what this would be like, so I took a look at the IMDb website. I did find a possible synopsis of Ripper Street and I found that Miller is a",1
" This movie seemed to lose any element of creepy from its inception, and just became one big happy, copious love scene. It's just a heartening sight to see a Brooklynite, a black man, falling for a white woman, and being loved back by that woman. It's a pretty uplifting film as well, especially since it is directed by a white man",1
" Not very much has been written about ""The King's Speech."" Few films are as beloved by critics as this one. The film's director, Tim Burton, had previously produced another Oscar-nominated musical, ""The Wizard of Oz,"" and the film was scary while still being (at least in my opinion) hilarious. Johnny Depp plays King George VI. At the",1
" I was first introduced to the moviemaking world through the works of Peter Jackson, David Attenborough and Peter Jackson himself. When I first saw the picture 'Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' I was blown away. I thought how they had taken the idea from the source material and made it into a fully realized movie. This film is an absolute triumph,",1
" Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore has returned to the form of his ""slick, clever, insightful dissident"" standard (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2003). The new one is without doubt his best... A filmmaker for the 21st century, Michael Moore has risen to the occasion in a way few others have. Moore has not only risen to the occasion with",1
" A DOUBLE LIFE is a deliciously theatrical film, at least for those who don't mind the fact that it's a little too cute for school. I've seen it twice in a theater, and both times it made me laugh out loud in the theater. Best of all, it's not merely an animated film. It's actually a film! A fascinating,",1
