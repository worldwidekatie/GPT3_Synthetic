" I saw this film when it first came out and have watched it again and again and again. In fact, when I got my first DVD player I bought it without question! There is something about this movie that is particularly appealing. It may be the story itself or the characters and the way both are portrayed. Or, could it be the music? All I can say is",1
" This movie is definitely a case of ""don't judge a book by its cover,"" as I was expecting a typical dumb 1950's western, and instead was pleasantly surprised by a wonderful movie with great acting and a real heart. Sinatra's character has to grow up in the movie, and he does so wonderfully. It's hard to believe that this was the first movie he",1
" I saw this movie on TV when I was a kid and I loved it. I've been a big Dean Martin fan ever since, but he really outdoes himself playing the abusive big brother with a chip on his shoulder. The ""starry night"" song is classic Sinatra and the fight scene in the bar is classic Martin. The climactic fight in the street between",1
" I was able to see this movie many, many times the one and only time I worked at a movie theatre when I was a teenager. I fell in love with this film from then on. I now have it on DVD. I have not seen this film for many years so I decided to watch it again. It brought back many old memories. I especially loved the way",1
" This was a very good western even though it's a little slow paced but what can you do, you still have to watch it. ",1
" Also, about that final scene, when he's in jail, being told, ""You're a killer,"" and then he answers, ""Yes, I am,"" that IS a good line. It's an answer to a question that we've all asked ourselves: what if you really are a killer? We all fantasize about it once in a while, but do we",1
" It's a shame Sinatra was at the end of his career and I've seen and heard him do better. Overall, the movie is fun, with the exception of Conrad's one-dimensional performance in a key role. Note the cameos by Woody Strode and Rosey Grier. ",1
" see 'The Man From Laramie,' saying that Lee Marvin's character there is similar. But it's not. Sure, both movies involve a character who is framed for a crime he didn't commit, and both have some scenes in which the framed guy is wearing a ball and chain. But in 'Concho,' the framed guy didn't actually commit the crime --",1
" I just spent an hour-and-a-half marathon watching this movie. I've always liked it from the first time I saw it on HBO. Along with ""The Magnificent Seven,"" it's one of my favorite westerns. Sinatra is really good. I'll give this movie a 9.5 out of 10. ",1
" As a fan of westerns, and a collector of western films, I am always looking for that one ""new"" film that I have not seen before, and that will be a treat to watch. This movie is that treat! As a long time fan of both Frank Sinatra and Sterling Hayden, this movie is a real treat for me. I have not seen this",1
" One of my favorite westerns. I watched it when I was a kid. Countless times. Still, do I watch it once in a while. ",1
" If you like westerns with lots of action, you are going to be very disappointed. It actually has very little action in it. However, if you like westerns with a little more story than action, a little more character development, a little more psychology, then you are going to be very pleasantly surprised. Sinatra is excellent in the mellow leading role, and",1
" A much underrated movie. The director is excellent, the story is good, the cinematography is good. The actors are great. A low-key, but highly entertaining movie. ",1
 I saw this film in my youth at a drive-in when it first came out. I still remember the night and my car was smoking so had to open a window. The film is just as good today. An excellent western in which Frankie and James Cagney play the roles of brothers. The cast is excellent and the action is great. This film is a must,1
 I was a teenager of about 12 when I first saw this movie on TV and have to admit that the title scared me. Somehow I had a picture of a vicious little dog in my mind. So I was surprised to see that it was actually a beautiful white stallion. And I was amazed to see that the horse was one of the main characters of the movie. And,1
" The western is largely a tale of ""it is better to have loved and lost than not loved at all"". ""Concho"" is a truism of that tenet. Sinatra in an Oscar winning performance plays a young man who is in love with the wife of a vicious outlaw (Conrad). After killing her husband, Sinatra attempts to reach the woman he loves",1
" On the surface, 'Concho' is a simple western, with an intriguing premise: Billy the Kid, who's been at his heels for the past decade, finally catches up to Ringo in a small Texas town where the sheriff is killed by an outlaw. (The town is so desperate for law that they don't even lock their doors.) The townspeople are",1
" You can't beat a movie with a cast like this! What a cast! And George Sidney directed it too. It's a great story, well acted and produced. It's a shame that Dino never made a movie like this again. But, then again, he didn't make a movie like 'From Here to Eternity' again either. ",1
" This movie is a bit dated in 1956 standards. It is has no sexual overtones what so ever. It is a western that has story, character development and a very strong plot with a wonderful twist at the end. When it comes to western film-making, this is a shining example of how to do a western the way it used to be done. The characters are",1
" This movie is a great western. The main character, played by James Murray, is a young man who travels to the New Mexico territory to make a new start. The movie is about his personal struggle to build a cattle ranch, raise a family, and yet not compromise his integrity as he faces violence, death and political corruption. The movie is also about how James Murray's",1
" I love this movie. It has a good story line, the actors are great, and plus it takes place in New Orleans which is my favorite city. I can really relate to this story line because I am a tomboy for the most part and I have a lot of guy friends. I'm not interested in getting married, kids, etc. This movie is one of",1
" I was on Lifetime movie network and I saw this movie, The Wronged Man. I was very interested in the plot because I was like me, why hasn't anyone made a movie out of this? So I was very curious to know whether this would be a good movie or a bad movie. I normally don't watch Lifetime movie network because I don't like their movies",1
 I have seen this movie and even though I kind of knew who the killer was from the beginning I still liked watching it. I would recommend it to other people. It comes on Lifetime movie network quite a lot. And I am thinking since it's close to Halloween they might play it more. So please be on the look out for it if you are interested in watching it,1

" It's a decent movie. It's not exactly my cup of tea, but it wasn't a terrible film. There's no nudity, so for you fans of that you'll be disappointed. There's a car chase, which involves the characters in the film that's okay in my book, and there's a few unexpected deaths which is also a plus. I have to",1
" This is a good family movie. I would recommend it. I believe that the whole family could sit down and watch this movie and it would be entertaining for each and everyone one of them. I do believe that the plot is predictable, but I am not going to say anything about that so you can figure it out for yourself. I do think the movie was a little to",1
 The plot of this movie is very good. But the ending is what blew me away. It was so unexpected. I did not see it coming and I absolutely loved it. There is so many twists and turns in this film that you will not know what is going to happen next. The only thing I didn't like about this movie is that fact that they didn't give,1

 This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It is really interesting to see how a woman can manipulate everyone around her just to get what she wants. Yep that's when I realized that she was the killer. But once you find out who the killer is. You will be shocked. It has a twist that I didn't see coming. And,1
 I wish I would have known that this movie was going to be a real life story when I decided to watch it. I am a big fan of The Shield. Michael Chiklis (The Shield) has always been such a great actor. I didn't like his role in this movie as much as I liked his role in the Shield. But I do think that it,1
 This movie is absolutely hilarious and I love it. I am not sure what I loved more about it; it's cast or the funny lines. Kevin Dillon is absolutely hilarious and does such a great job at showing you just how socially retarded he really is. Alicia Silverstone does a great job at playing a crazy ex girlfriend and her snarkiness really makes the movie. The,1
 I will admit I was a little iffy on this movie when I first saw it. The opening scene with the scientist and the medical experiment that was going wrong. I was like what the heck was that about but as I continued to watch the movie it all fell into place. It was actually very interesting. The movie is based on a book by James Patterson. I have,1

" This movie was very well done. I have to say that its a fairly new movie, but I really enjoyed it. I like watching Robin Tunney in a lot of roles, I think she is a really good actress. This movie did not have any big stars in it, but I think it was a good movie to watch, because it was a good storyline. Overall",1
 I can't believe that this movie is finally coming out on DVD! It has been a long wait. This movie is so good and if you haven't seen it you should! I have so many memories watching this movie when it came out. I have watched it probably dozen of times and couldn't get enough of it. I loved how they put a twist on what is,1
" I like this movie, a lot. I would recommend it to anyone. I have seen it a few times and enjoy it every single time. It is on TMC a lot. Time for the review. The movie is really good and has a lot of suspense to it. The killer is so creepy and he really creeps me out. The clothes and the way he looks",1
 I love this movie. I am such a huge fan of Alicia Silverstone and Kevin Dillon. They did a great job as did the rest of the cast. I am so glad that they were able to bring this movie to the big screen. I am a huge fan of the original Stake Land and I think that the writers out did themselves with the sequel. I hope,1
 I think that this is a movie that was worth watching. It's not up there in my favorites but it was good. It was a interesting movie. It was a good mystery and I loved watching it.

 This is an awesome series. I couldn't wait to watch Episode 1. I just got done watching Episode 2 and I can't wait to watch Episode 3. I have always been a fan of The Sopranos so it was great to see Vincent Pastore playing his part on this series. You will see a lot of familiar faces from The Sopranos on this series,1
" Although the film's beautiful, old-fashioned art direction, costumes, and photography make it look like a lavish period piece, it's not. The movie is set in present-day London, with anachronisms like fax machines and mobile phones. The spirit of the film, however, is unmistakably, and even thrillingly, 19th-century. I",1
" History lesson for the day: The Chinese invented gunpowder. The first cannons were made by the Chinese, not the Europeans, and were used by them to rout Mongol invaders in the 14th century. In the early 17th century, the Chinese had enough sense to realize that giant towers with giant cannons mounted on them (in a country with no horses) were not going to",1
" In a way, the clearest, most fundamental vision of love shared by a man and a woman is also the most opaque: a kiss. This single gesture contains multitudes, none of which are unmixed with fear. Fear of rejection, of intimacy, of engulfment. A kiss, in a way, can also be the most powerful weapon in a relationship, too",1
" The story of the burning of the 47 Ronin in 1837 is one of the most stirring episodes of the time of the Tokugawa Shogunate. This action was part of the long drama that led to the fall of that government and the restoration of the Emperor, but it is sufficiently known in Japan to have provided the basis of several films, usually set in the Ed",1
" This is a competent, if slightly dull, made-for-TV film that fails to explore the dramatic possibilities of its subject matter. The story is of the conflict in the 14th century between the Catholic Church and the supporters of the theory of the Earth's rotation. Some of the Church leaders were vehemently opposed to this theory. Typical of these was a Dominican friar,",1
 `Pieces of April' is a portrait of an eccentric family and the daughter who doesn't fit it. The daughter is the best thing about the movie. The movie is a reminder of how good Kristin Scott Thomas was in 'The English Patient.' Thomas has a subtle style that captures a fuzzy warmth. ,1
" There were at least a half dozen silent-film versions of Shakespeare's ""The Merchant of Venice,"" and there have been several television productions. But no one has ever gotten around to making a big-budget theatrical feature from the play . . . until now. Given the nature of the play/s most memorable character, Shylock the Nasty Jew, it's a",1
" Documentary about the making of a movie that never made it to the screen. TRIVIA: Originally titled ""Production Hell."" 1. Although billed as a 'documentary', the film is more in the style of 'A Hard Days Night' - a behind-the-scenes look at a chaotic production. 2. The film stars the members of Monty Python.",1
" ""The Merchant Of Venice"" opens with one of the most memorable opening scenes of all time. Al Pacino plays Jewish moneylender Shylock, who is trying to collect a loan he gave to a young (and very foolish) nobleman named Bassanio (Jeremy Irons). Across town, the beautiful daughter of a wealthy merchant (Natalie Portman)",1
" The new Michael Radford version of ""The Merchant of Venice"" owes nothing to Shakespeare and nothing to most of the movie versions of ""The Merchant of Venice"" that have preceded it. It is a Michael Radford movie, with a few elements of ""The Merchant of Venice"" thrown in to give it a pretext for being. It is about a lot of things: prejudice",1
" Based on the life of Steve Biko, who was a black South African anti-apartheid activist, this stunning and powerful film was superbly made and had a very good cast. This is a very good film and one of the best in the year in my opinion. ",1
" It's hard to think of a better actor for the part than Al Pacino and, in fact, he delivers the best performance of his career. Somewhat amazingly, it's not the best thing about the film. It also isn't a movie for the whole family, unless they're very, very morally serious. It's a movie for adults and the very, very",1
" The Merchant of Venice (1996) is a very good movie. It is very well directed, thought out, and acted. It is not a fun film, but it is a good one. Al Pacino is amazing as Shylock, one of the best performances of his career. There are several reasons I do not think this film is for everyone. First, it",1
" I have finally gotten around to seeing the Merchant of Venice. However, I must say, I am a bit disappointed. The film was okay, but it seems to be more about Shylock, and him being an anti-semite, then about the plot. Although Al Pacino was great as Shylock, and the movie had some good comedy, it was",1
" Visuals and dialogue are the two most obvious areas that need improvement in the movie. The film is filled with mediocre effects and poor editing, but it is still a lot of fun to watch. The film is a bit of a mess. The movie takes some quite intriguing ideas and blends it with a few bad ones, and the result is less than perfect. But that doesn",1
" You know you're watching something special when you've seen a film three times and can still anticipate each and every one of its surprises. That's the way I felt about ""The Truman Show,"" the most original and best film of 1998. The movie, by first-time director Peter Weir, is about Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey), a man in his 30s",1
" This is a difficult movie to evaluate, and not because it's a stinker. It isn't. It's one of the most impressive, intelligent and affecting films I've ever seen based on a Shakespeare play. Pacino, who co-wrote the screenplay, plays Shylock, the shrewd and scheming Jewish moneylender who takes the life of the young",1
" It's a very grim and dismal and bleak world in which the characters in THE MERCHANT OF VENICE live. It's not a good time to be a Christian, especially a young one. The movie begins with a young man, Shylock's daughter's fiance, running away from home to avoid being forced into converting to Christianity. At the beginning of the",1
" I'm not a fan of Al Pacino, but this movie was great. Its a dark comedy about an Italian mob boss who decides to remake his image. Totally hilarious, Pacino is funny as hell, so is Alan Arkin who plays his partner. I was laughing so hard that my face hurt by the time the movie was over. Its one of those movies that",1
" Michael Radford's adaptation is a bold one that opens ""The Merchant of Venice"" up to a new audience. Radford was able to present Shakespeare's infamous ""Merchant of Venice"" by taking some liberties with the text. He cut out some of the more tedious portions, such as the opening scene where Portia's father is lining up suitors for his daughter.",1

" A tough subject handled well. S/M is presented as a lifestyle choice and a way of life first and foremost with violence second. I'm a bit surprised at how well it was handled. This movie certainly won't win any awards for originality, but is an entertaining and thought provoking foray into the loveless world of sadomasochistic love. I've got",1

 A perfect film with hilarious stunts. The slapstick comedy is very funny and the supporting cast are very funny.<br /><br />The film is all about two hobos and a train robber.

" This is an offbeat film in the vein of ""Twin Peaks"".....that is not in the mainstream.....but is an enjoyable ride.....thanks in part to the fine acting of Justin Timberlake! He has that aura about him.....which is both charming and ""in the know"".....and is able to easily command the screen! If you enjoy ""Twin Peaks",1

The opening sequence of the police arriving at a dark and rainy house wherein the ""wife"" has committed murder.......or is it??....and the remainder of the film seeks to unravel what really happened....OK...the film is",1
" What a great movie! It's so simple yet profound. For those unfamiliar with the book and the movie, you'll learn a lot about the Armenian Genocide and the Turcans. I was very stunned by the brutal realities of the movie. I couldn't believe it. It was a total shock to me. I've never seen anything like it. It's a must",1
" I was amazed at how enjoyable this film became. Refreshing to see a new romantic comedy with a twist on the old formula. The settings were beautiful, the acting was great, and the story was original. I highly recommend this movie. ",1
" A good movie with a lot of realism. Strong performances by everyone. The ending was shocking, yet, quite believable. The ending was a bit rushed & not as powerful as the rest of the movie. The only reason I give it an 8 instead of a 9. At least 10 years ahead of its time. ",1
" There were times when I felt like killing myself while watching this movie because it was so bad. But, on the good side, I didn't. Let me explain something. I'm a pretty good judge of what makes a bad movie. A bad movie is one in which you can tell from the first few minutes that it's going to be bad. This movie was bad",1
" There is a very good reason why this gem of an action movie is not as well known by the masses....it is definitely not your typical ""action movie""!

" Five stars for a film that not only is a gripping thriller murder mystery...but one that is very artistic! The director is a real master of photography and lighting which adds so much to the film. You must see only at night to fully appreciate it. The way the film is edited just adds so much to the development of the story. The story is obviously fiction, but",1

 Great movie. Very enjoyable. ,1
" I really enjoyed this series. Despite the lack of decent special effects, the acting was good, the writing was good, the story was good. I thought this show would have done a lot better if it had been released during the 50s or 60s like many of the other sci-fi TV shows that it emulated. I like the fact that it's more of",1
" This film is just an average film to watch on a cold Sunday evening......when the wife is away at her meeting.......but there is nothing wrong with this movie....a well-known cast of seasoned actors....and a story line that keeps your attention.

 I like this movie. I found it very entertaining and interesting. It has a little mystery and romance and comedy and action and everything. The acting is good. The character Jenny is so sweet and naive. It was so fun to watch a movie about high school students that is clean and not full of sex and profanity. You don't have to worry about bad language in,1

" The SEVEN ASSASSINS was a breakthrough film for Yasujiro Ozu.

The plot revolves around a gangster who is determined to get rid of the boss of the local yakuza. The yakuza",1
" IN MAY was directed by Jan Troell in 1986. It is a highly underrated film which strives to realistically show the life of real Swedish immigrants in America in 1910. It is a wonderful, quiet film which shows a simple, yet harsh life of the immigrants. It is beautifully shot, and tells a terrific story. The story revolves around one man, who at the beginning of",1

He goes to live with his godfather, a middle class, lonely old anarchist who lives alone in a run",1
" THE ASCENT is a very worthwhile addition to recent re-releases from the Soviet Union. Director Larisa Shepitko's 1977 film examines the moral ramifications of allegiance and honor in German occupied Russia during The Second World War. On foot and in a blizzard, two members of a partisan Soviet group leave to locate supplies, and are captured by Nazi soldiers. The focus",1
 THE ASCENT is an excellent film about the moral implications of collaboration during World War 2. This is an important aspect of the war that is not often addressed. I highly recommend it. ,1
" This is the best film I have seen yet by director Lee Chang-dong. It is a thoughtful and unique look at the enigma of human love. The story concerns a recently-widowed and possibly unstable woman, who has acquired a new live-in lover. He is a garbage collector, and she is the wife of a prominent and successful businessman.

The movie stars Guy Pearce in a supporting role, but it's really about two attractive young men who are both in love with the same man. It's predictable, it's not offensive, it just isn",1
" HOWELLS' MARRIAGE is a very well done production that succeeds in combining both action and drama into an interesting and entertaining narrative.

I wholeheartedly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a great drama. ",1

" A glorious film for anyone who loves Shakespeare. The cast is uniformly excellent, the cinematography is beautiful, and the story is very well told. Kenneth Branagh is brilliant in the title role, and you can understand why he chose to cast himself. The character of Hamlet is so complicated and Branagh does it so well. The ghost scenes are well done, and the",1

But it is an intelligent film that pulls you in and leaves you unsettled. The violence is not gratuitous, but is somehow off center. It is the way",1

The story is enhanced by the acting, and it is a GREAT story. I highly recommend this dvd to anyone who enjoys Shakespeare or a good movie.

" I'm a big fan of Shakespeare, and I've seen this play performed in the traditional theater form, as a modern extravaganza, and as a version for children.

 The first time I saw this movie was at the IMAX theater when I was 5 years old and it scared the shit out of me. I don't know what it was but it was just so damn confusing and I was too young to even understand what was going on. I didn't see it again until I was 25. In a way it's a classic and it,1

 A rainy weekend that I had off work prompted me to rent a movie. This one was the only one that I could find that would accommodate my very narrow movie taste. This might sound stupid but the first time I saw this movie was when I was around 7 years old. I'm 17 now and that still holds true. This movie is the best movie I've ever seen,1
 Great movie! It's about a man who was falsely accused of rape. The movie shows how he get's out of it. The book is much better. It's also hilarious and I must say nothing will ever beat the car chase! ,1
