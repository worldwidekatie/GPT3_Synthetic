" this is a pretty good movie, it has uplifting music that is sad but also very catchy and the actors do an excellent job in their roles.

Although the characters and setting are of much lower caliber than in the original, that doesn't stop it from capturing the spirit of the original movie. This movie takes place in the days before the revolution, and you discover that the revolution is being planned by the",0

" I was a little bit disappointed with this movie even though it had good dialogue and it had a lot of good thrills and scares. Maybe its too long, but I don't think this is my favorite of the first 3. It's definitely a Fantasy Film, and its a pretty good one too. This one shows a lot of talent in the cast including Stanley Smith,",0
" A story about a teenager with a dark secret - that he's gay. A spin-off from the popular Stranger (released in 1955) where the story is told from the point of view of that character. A very pretty, dark comedy, but I found it lacking in the very first episode. It was OK at best, but it's a nice way to start.",0
" This movie is one of those movies you will watch when you are alone, or in a dark room, and you will just witness a stranger's life through another man's eyes, and that's the best way I can describe it. John Wayne is a faithful copy of his famous character in the Bogie and Bogie 2 movies. A handsome cowboy who is a bum escaped",0
" Well there you have it. Oh, Lord, I've been writerly challenged by a movie I really didn't like. I enjoyed the first few scenes, but it wasn't enough to knock me out of bed the next morning. I did enjoy the supporting characters, but I was just not engaged enough to keep watching. Enter the robots. If you haven't seen it",0

" The very first thing i noticed about this movie in comparison to any other movie i have seen was the horrible acting. Least of all Alvin Ross he's the dumbest, stupider and most annoying actor i've ever seen. The movie opens with him talking to a girl and she kills herself because he says that she's from a ""nice family"" in the future",0
" I was in the theater last night and got to see this movie. Celeste Williams did a decent job as the female lead. She was enthusiastic and energetic. Celeste was also very funny in small role and really carried it in this film. She was kind of saddled with that super hot, guy. But she did her job in this movie and most of the movie",0
" this movie is a lot of fun to watch. I think the acting is pretty good as well; the only actors in this movie are Baldwin and Williams(for the most part). There are some funny moments in the movie, but out of the actors themselves many of the performances are just a bit too predictable to keep the whole movie from being repetitive. I'd actually recommend this",0
" So you thought it was gonna be funny. And yep, it was funny. You thought it was gonna be a lot of fun. But this is like watching a bad cat. It's not funny at all and just mind-numbingly boring. ",0
" well i'd say that lindy linspring would be a better choice for this movie. her character is excellent and haves that sort of strong mother in law attitude, i dont know anything about her but i know she was a fine actress the only thing i considered wrong with it was the overly dramatic ending. ",0
" This was an upgrade from the last two I watched. It's not perfect, but its just a different take on one of my all time favorite dramas. If you're into the orignal tv show, I recommend the series, but I don't think this is a MST3K movie and therefore not worth doing a review on. ",0
" I finally saw this movie and the poor script got me riled up in the theater for the first time. I liked the main theme and the theme songs, but this was a not a very good film. I was expecting more, and it didn't come. Felt sorry for the director because of his good intentions, but I was afraid his direction and scary visuals didn",0
" The story is really bad, the acting is bad, the plot is bad, and the script is usually good, but the film is actually not such a bad film. But it is a poor attempt at serious film making. You think it's funny, but it's just bad. The only reason it's even a movie is because it has the ""Star Wars"" theme",0
" This is a pretty lame bar-filling sound-alike, but it does have some good songs. In particular, the soundtrack does a pretty good job of drawing you into the plot and the movie itself. Unfortunately, some of the performances aren't nearly enough to hold yourself entranced and entertained, but the music is a fun, high-energy mix of Celtic",0
" While John Lee Hancock very well could have acted as a competent lead, he does nothing of interest and is about as much fun as a good Cuban cigar. The story is a bit hokey, the cast is about as good as a Red Sox fan could be (if you can get him to speak French and play the piano) and the performances are bland and unremarkable",0
" The plot might as well be in the library at the library. The bad guy is a straight-up scary snake-head. If he was a snakehead, he'd be this scary, but he's a man of pure evil. I guess it's a good story though, because it has a good ending. But its only plot isn't quite as good as the",0

" The movie was a very good movie but I am sure the director, the writer and the actors who are the best in the world, some of the people who made this movie can stay out of the film industry if they want to, but a good movie is most of all made for the general public to see, and the general public want to see a good movie. a",0

" Yeah i love the movie but it just didn't do it for me. It would've made a great 1965 film. Which is why I have to agree with those that think this is a great classic. My only real point of view on this movie is that it too could've been made in another country. To be honest, this is a tired film as the plot is",0
" It's hard to review this movie. I mean I'm sure this wouldn't be that good if the whole thing was bad but it's not. I mean the actors were amazing.

" I had seen this movie a few times and had already figured it out. I'm not a science fiction fanatic but when it comes to science fiction I like the idea more than the reality.

 The movie had horrible special effects. But that was ok because it was such a bad production that they didn't look beautiful at all. ,0
 I would've liked to see more like this but life's just not fair right is henty. but it is ok. I think people like this film are getting older and more mature so it's okay if they dont think too much about it but it was still funny. Now you can look at a new film and say oh its fucking pathetic it's like some people,0
 i think this film has given a lot of people a lot of bad reasons for not seeing it. It is a horrid film and it should be taken out of the movie and studied. I want you to go watch this film and learn about how it was made and why it's crap. ,0
" I used to watch this so much when I was younger that if I saw it again I'd hold up my hand and say ""shit rip out the comapny and give this a miss"". I think this movie is a bit of an offender in that it's been passed over as too dull and uninteresting because the R rated cast was more a joke than anything else.",0

Actually, the show started about 10 or 15 minutes into the movie and we got the feeling that it wasn't going to end fast enough. ",0
" I've been a fan of Joe Rogan's since I first saw him on his original Showtime show, The Rog Show. I was amazed that Joe was able to do such a fine job of teaching how to talk while continuing to be a master of comedy. I've even told a few friends of his that I've seen a couple of his commercial spots live. I've",0

" This is one of the best films of all-time, and it's been a long time coming. It's hard to believe The Love List, the true story of a man who tried to kill his wife and daughter, can be as enjoyable and as gripping as The Love List is. As someone who has read all the books by the time the film came out I was",0
" I got this film at the cinema, expecting an action flick, and it turned out to be a very low budget film. It was very inconsistent and made me feel very conflicted. I liked how the cast of the film was very interesting, especially Ben Glover (the actor who played John Marks), but I was still watching it wondering ""What the hell is going on?"".",0
" I was not too happy when I first saw this movie. I'm glad it was not my first picture of the day before I sat down to watch it. This movie seems to have been created solely to make money, and I guess so is this movie. As I began watching this movie I was saddened. I can't help but agree with many other reviewers that this film",0
" This film was the first one for me, and it was a total disappointment. I was very excited to see these men of the night coming of age of the 20th century, but the movie didn't do anything to tie up the mystery of who they were and why they were there. Maybe the producers had been thinking of this as a bank robber thriller, but the film",0
" I saw this film the other day and was pleasantly surprised. If you are a fan of the Romeo and Juliet stories, then you will definitely enjoy this film. But of course you can't have a romantic comedy without chicks and the film is very about how far women want to go. ",0
" This is a great film and just a great film. A very interesting, fascinating and very entertaining film. ",0
" This isn't really a movie. It's a series of stories. However, if you are into tightrope theatre and true-life drama, then I would highly recommend it. It starts out as a delight when two friends are on a break from each other about to go to a gig and find themselves in a dark place... ",0
" I got this movie because it was on during the summer and I didn't want to watch the movie in December. After seeing it and being blown away with the tale and the phenomenal performance of Joanne Woodward it was a must see! A masterful performance, a wonderful film. ",0
" Yeah I saw this movie because there is a special DVD on DVD that I have to order and I am unable to get my hands on it! I was absolutely shocked by the film and I felt it deserved to be in movie theaters, but it's just not existent. M: God this film was horrible! It is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I",0
" I'm not a fan of this movie that we were disappointed that we couldn't watch it. I really think though that there is a lot going on here, and there is some hard to get behind in the plot. I think it's the best of the films we've seen with a decent cast, and it also has some nice dialogues and scenes. One thing I",0
" I know that there are a lot of movies out there, but there are some that I really hate the most. There is something so wrong with the whole concept that you can't help but hate every single one of them. The problem is that there are some movies that make me laugh so hard that it makes me want to start drinking. And there is also some movies that",0
" This movie is awful. It's so bad that it's like a bad version of a bad Batman movie. It's so bad, I'm afraid to write this review because I don't want to look like I just wanted to see it. This movie is so bad that I don't think I can ever see it again! I've seen the trailer and I was all",0
" Is it time for school? You will get a lot of questions in this movie. They don't really want to know that you are a monster in high school, but they are curious about the ""story"" of this movie. The whole premise of the film is ridiculous, but there is something to it. Just my opinion. ",0
" God bless the filmmakers of ""Happiness in Hell."" They made this beautiful film about a terrible place where no one goes and most people die. I'm not kidding, this film shows what it is like to die on planet Earth. The silent footage of the dead, the way the air smelled when you breathed it and the families of the dead, it's just horrible.",0
 Since I just can't stand to see one of my favorite directors with someone else's money I decided to watch the film with my private screening group and I am not ashamed to say my least favorite director in the world was involved in a love triangle during the film. ,0

It's a must see movie if you need to see an unrelenting, chilling, obviously sad film. 5/5<br /><br />I really enjoyed the movie. It was made by one of the best directors's out there, and the acting was fantastic. For a",0
" This movie didn't make me change my opinion, I'm a huge fan of horror and smart horror and watching this film is very appalling. I am very skeptical and I have never seen a film that is this horrible, such a disaster, I didnt even want to watch this movie, this is the worst horror movie since the horrible horror movies in the 80's.

" When me and my GF went to see this film, we didn't know what to expect, however she assured me that it had good reviews. So I went along with it. We got into the cinema and bought tickets and went into the screen. After a while of sitting there waiting for the film to start no one else walked through the door. I was very suspicious as",0
" Boy, this is a horrible film. It's based on a book that became a movie. DON'T BUY it. ",0
" This was a good film at the start of the week. I didn't like it much, but got into it and enjoyed it. The plot was interesting enough and at a point where I could get into it. I think the main problem was that things didn't just happen, there was a lot of exposition of what had been going on or had happened before, but there",0
" I was really excited to see this film on the big screen, especially becuase I've been waiting for it for over 10 years. I can honestly say that this was my first time seeing a film in its original version on the large screen, because that was also an arduous task. The actors were all very talented. I can't believe that what this film has",0
" This is one of those films that I found entertaining enough, I'm going to say that it's a must see for the great movie fan that deserves to see it. Just be aware of the fact that the film is a bit hard to follow. The main character is voiced by Tom Hanks. I have to admit that I have to admit that I heard each character before",0
" I just finished watching this film. I was surprised at the way the film was put together, it seemed so contrived. The movie didn't very much. The story was somewhat interesting, but the way it was put together was so bad that it was predictable. So many annoying and pointless scenes that made me wish that it had been just a short movie. It was a",0
" When I heard that Blockbuster was closing all the horror movies, I looked through our storage box in the basement and saw the box was open.

" This was the stickiest part of this movie for me. I had always liked the idea of a ghost story, but this one I could not get through. I just wanted to get to the story so that I could see what was going on. I cannot think of a better movie about a ghost story. So much so that this is a movie I have to see at",0
" A very well done thriller, but I don't watch things like that anymore. The film did not work for me. There's a reason you make a movie like this, most of the viewers are decent people, most of the viewers of this film were no where near decent, the movie was so bad that I felt bad for the characters and I failed at the plot.",0
" This is one of those movies that costs a fortune to make, and people are much better off not seeing this type of crap in any venues. It is a movie with a very very young cast of actors, and it feels like they are being cucked and their performances are all wrong. That is just one example of how in this movie, we are not supposed to believe",0
" I kind of get why this guy is this way, I can be a jerk and certainly do not like to be teased and I don't want to be bullied, but I really don't care that much for the whole movie. I don't think I could read this if I was given the chance to do so. The portrayal of the group of individuals that they are trying",0
" I am not a big horror fan, besides the films from our local theatre. But I must admit, this movie was good. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the whole premise of this movie, that people are going into a building and they are going to be eaten. ",0
" This is a movie that is just so bad that it is actually better in a way. It's not a bad movie, it just really doesn't work for me. I'm not going to lie, it is a movie I can watch over and over and over and over and it still doesn't have any of the charm that I think a horror movie should have. RE",0
" It's a dirty trick. It's a home run. I'm going to admit that the plot is twisted, but it's still a great story. I absolutely loved how the movie focused on two characters that were in the most pivotal situation for them: Brian and Marion and then the two of them were thrust together perfectly. ",0
" I am not a big horror fan, but this did not disappoint. I was a little baffled by the insanity that was going on from the beginning, but I also was amazed at the way that it was done in such a professional way. The finale was a little confusing because all the characters know that they are real, yet they still don't recognize themselves.I was really",0
" Although not a horror classic, ""Don't Look Now"" has a decent plot. There are some strange situations going on, but overall the movie is enjoyable. With good actors and a very strong storyline, it is a well made movie.<br /><br />With director Steven Bochco and cast that includes Gary Busey, Nancy Allen, Ernest Borgnine,",0
 When I first saw this movie I was expecting to be totally sucked into a large movie that didn't make me laugh too much. It had a very cheesy premise with a very long running story. When going to see the movie it was as if you were being filmed a scene from a movie. I was just a little disappointed as I figured this was going to be a fun,0
 This movie is a total waste. The director and the writer were both terrible. The first 3 hours are suspenseful but then things just get dumb. I can't believe someone turned in for the first 3 hours of the movie. The movie is a 1 hour ride. ,0
" ""Horror from the far end of the road"" is a pro-horror flick every bit as bad as the real thing. Cast: Tom Savini, Mary-Louise Parker, and Johnny Depp. The movie stars Tom Savini, Mary-Louise Parker, Johnny Depp, Paul Simon, and John Travolta. ",0
" It is, to put it mildly, absolutely horrible. I've seen similar films from the 80's and the 90's and they were also horrible. But this isn't one of them.<br /><br />This movie is a film about what it means to be alone in a world with a million people. You are a lone wolf, you are you. You are",0
" When you sit down to write a novel, what do you expect is going to happen? I'm not qualified to answer a question in this format, but I will. A book is supposed to be a collection of characters, but in this case there was no going back and forth. This is not a book about Robert Redford or Robin Williams, it is about a man",0
" This movie was so bad that it is worth the price of admission. It is horrible<br /><br />I was not impressed with this movie. The shooting of the movies is terrible. The actors are horrible, the pacing is horrible and it is so bad that I thought the reviews would be better<br /><br />Anyway, I went on to see The",0
" Very good movie with a great cast, but the story was very much in the realm of nonsense. ",0
" Yes, I am going to make a point about this film, especially because this is especially bad because it is bad. I'm going to explain it in simpler terms because that is what I'm about to tell you.<br /><br />I don't think I'm making a type of movie about a guy who is trying to kill his girlfriend, I think this is",0
" Never before has any of the supernatural horror genre been presented in such a way. This movie is worth checking out if you want to see a movie that is not only scary, but also humorous. It is a very entertaining film. ",0
" Do not listen to the producer who made this movie. In my opinion this movie is garbage. Every actor did a very good job except for some that were given more time to do their thing. That aside, this movie is flat out bad. I was introduced to this movie at a library and while I was reading it I was amazed at how bad the movie actually was.",0
" At this point I am beyond disgusted. This movie is a disaster from beginning to end, and I don't have the words to express how unneeded it was to watch it. ",0
" This movie may have been one of the better films of its year, but it really couldn't make it to the cut-stone of the best horror films of that particular year. I could argue that the maker of this movie could have shown us a better idea of what to expect from the film, but instead it went for the first easily condemned idea of a white person trying",0
" I don't know, but I think there has to be a cure for time travel in this movie. It was totally over-hyped and over-done. A few small details like the fact that there was supposed to be a small boy, but he had to be the kid or the parents can't have the parts the other two are supposed to have, and the",0
" This movie would do justice to the horror genre. The problem I found with the movie was its running time. It was just under two hours, but because a lot of people get so wrapped up in the horror genre that the movie would have to run much longer. This movie would have been great if the hour and a half was longer, but it didn't work for me",0
" I am a huge fan of cheesy horror movies and this is only the 4th one I have ever seen. I have watched most of them, and I am sorry to say that they do not hold up any better than others. ",0
 This is a movie that has been around longer than the average person has lived. It is the type of movie that you could get rid of by putting some of the money in a vault into a dime bag and leaving the other crap that you can't really afford lying around. It is just a shame that so many studios seem to be so greedy that they don't want to,0
 I was initially surprised at how big of a role this play would have played in a horror movie. The first half of the movie was all about writing the script for the film and making the movie. When filming started it wasn't much of a problem because director Jeeves had the perfect cast for the movie. I was surprised when it wasn't that way when they started,0
" Yeah, let's be honest, I was only there to see what all the hype was about. It's the kind of movie where it could cause a small piece of shit to throw up in his mouth and for that reason I went into the movie expecting it to be good. It was all hype, and I had no idea what to expect.Standards. But not",0
" I had a very good laugh in here. The lead character is completely ridiculous and is actually so much fun that I laughed twice that night.<br /><br />I would not pay to see a film of this type again,with the exception of the shower scene, which is the only scene I would include in my film review.<br /><br />I would",0
" This is a story that should have no connection with the source material, but it does attempt to do something unique here. I liked the fact that the story was quite different from the rest of the movie. There was no blood, only the blood of a woman who had just lost her husband. I had to wonder what kind of woman this was. Then there was Jesse Bradford",0
" This is the worst I have ever seen! This movie that has been re-mastered in over 4,000 words<br /><br />You may notice that I used the misleading term 'horror' the entire movie. The first 20 minutes or so definitely aren't. I will give you my honest thoughts on this movie. ",0
" ""Cimarron"" is one of those movies that ""looks nice"" in trailers, but I'm not sure if it really is that good. I thought the first half of the movie was really good. I thought the second half was better. The original movie was very good. I'm not sure about this one. ",0
" I'm pretty sure that this movie gets a bad review or two for just because of the fact that it's a horror film. I personally think that it's a very unconventional horror movie, but it's not all bad. I have spent a lot of time on the internet talking to people who are looking for a good horror movie, and the only thing that makes this movie",0
 This is sooooooo bad that you will never watch it again. FILM NOVELLA GREEK ,0
" If you like the idea of a vampire in this movie, you will be pleasantly surprised. There's a lot of blood and a lot of gore in this movie. To me, there is something about the film that is appealing to me.I think that the movie is worth a look if that's your thing. If you don't like blood and gore, you might not",0
" I'm surprised that I haven't watched this flop before. It's a lot of fun to watch, to the point that it will reach into your chest, searching for the most disgusting thing that you can imagine. It's pretty fun to watch. I personally don't think it's for everyone, but I'm glad that you let the reviews be your judge of whether",0

I've never seen a bad horror movie, but this one was pretty shit. I assumed it would be a monster, but it was a vampire. There was a lot of killing, but there's also",0
" This is all just dreadful, and frankly, not worth the money to see it.<br /><br />I went into this with the idea that I would see a gritty thriller you would give up on at the first sight of vampire or zombie, well, I was totally wrong. I was expecting something more like the horror movies from the 80s. I think there is",0
 This was a good movie. It was fun to see the stars of the cable channel in their roles. It was a lot of fun. All of the actors played their roles well. I would definitely watch this again. ,0
" THIS MOVIE IS PRETTY MUCH ADDICTIVE<br /><br />Catch me, if you can't really see it, I'll tell you what it is.<br /><br />This movie has a major problem with it--it's not very scary. I'm talking about real monsters. It's a movie that is way too violent and unrealistic",0
" I know a lot of people complain about the movie in particular but I want to respond here and say it's not a horror movie at all. It's exhausting to point out that one because there's already an entire article on the subject, but I think there are a lot of ways to look at the movie and I'll focus on one more. For starters, this movie",0
" Absolute crap! The movie was unbelievable, as stated in the description. I'm sorry but this movie had no premise at all. A group of students who get trapped in their MATH class by the twist of fate fall into an argument about the ""unbelievable""ness of the school. I can't believe this movie had a plot. ",0
" As I was washing my dishes, they had turned out to be quite delicious!<br /><br />I had my first visit to the movie theater to see this movie. I was very impressed with the visuals, particularly the dim way the lights are cast on the setup (a little like a movie set). I would have said the same if a large room were lit",0
" This is by far the worst ever 'horror' movie, no, make that any movie, I have ever watched. Shame on Block Buster for even carrying this type of crap.<br /><br />The movie is so bad that I had to stop after just 15 minutes of watching it.<br /><br />I had more fun watching any of the fuzzy YouTube",0
" I have to say this is the worst horror movie to ever come out of the states. There are a lot of great words to describe it, but the script was so bad, and the acting so bad, that it could have done better. I'm so disappointed with this movie, and the way it was released. I'm willing to bet that it's a movie that",0
" This was such an obvious terrible movie. I don't think I had seen any of the 'Horror' movies I have seen before.<br /><br />This was like being in a post-apocalyptic zombie movie that had a twist, but was never meant to be, like a scene from the movie ""The Omen"". ",0
" Oh holy crap oh holy crap will this movie be better than the garbage that I just watched? I am so out of ideas about what to watch next.<br /><br />As someone who loves horror films, this is a movie that needs to be seen if your heart is set on this type of movie. ",0

I don't know whether I can suffer through this movie, but I don't think that will be an option. The characters are so bad that I can't even watch the movie. It's like one of those low budget horror cult movies",0
" How can you put into words how bad this movie is? It's just awful. Every single character is a fraud, because they're just so horrible it's almost funny. And there are a lot of people out there loving this movie. The only people who don't like it are people who are either brainwashed by the cult or using it as a vehicle in some sort",0
" !!!??? What a joke must this man have been, to think that he could pull this off on free-form television. When will people learn that their cartoons are not crafted as entertainment and are instead a tool to sell products. ",0
 This is a movie that's rubbish. The producers came up with this bunch of messed up ideas way before anyone else had an idea. They even had a story that was about the reasons it was good enough to be made into a movie. That's the reason why this movie is crap. ,0
 This movie is the definition of a horrible mess. Don't go see this movie! ,0

It has no real plot, and no character development. I've seen a lot of movies that suffer from this, but this is the worst. The movie was almost",0
" Just be glad you didn't see this one in its current form. The movie is so bad, I was never interested in it. This was the guy who was in a long line of movie makers that were able to make someone like Ben Affleck look pretty good. Sure, he's a big movie star, but he's also a nerd, so he didn't really",0
" Did this even get made? Not that anyone can blame him, but then again, I sure as hell don't believe this guy. As a bad storyteller, he's the worst. I'm not talking to anyone who watched the film for the first time, I'm talking to someone who watched it a few times. ",0
" First, let me make it quite clear that I have no bias against horror movies whatsoever. I'm just tired of seeing cheap, generic movies that are so bad, that I can't process them any better than I would if they were watching a crappy TV show. This movie, however...I can process it better than I can process a bunch of cheesy Jason Voorhe",0

" When a movie looks cool enough to make me want to pitch a tent in a local park, the direction is good enough to make me want to go see the movie.

" This was a horrible piece of ""horror"" in my opinion. I don't like to draw the line between what I like and what I don't, but this was a bad movie. Especially for a film released only a couple of years after a year's worth of flashing images on the screen. I can't really say it was bad, just a little bit disappointing",0
" ATHEY IS GONNA CALLED THIS UGLY!!! It's like the marketing handmaid. Completely unprofessional, childish, ineffective, over-hyped, and - a serious 'horror' plot - with a time-travelling car crash that has nothing to do with the movie's premise or plot. For example, the film's opening",0
" I consider this to be the worst movie of 1980. In fact, I am inclined to call this movie the worst (if not least) movie of the decade. It's so bad, in fact it could be considered a cult classic. The scene where Angelina and Nick are being shot from an airgun is so awful, it's ridiculous. The entire movie's about",0
" Here we are again with a mania that can't be explained. I'm all for love of movies, young adult movies, new movies, third party films, but this isn't one of those old fashioned, dusty holdover films.

" What a film! I have never seen a movie like this.<br /><br />This is true horror; it's not so much that other people are going to see it, but that the person who is going to see it is going to see something he will not like. And, it really isn't the movie. It's a hoax.<br /><br",0
" I got a surprise when someone from Blockbuster decided to create this on a short notice. Fools, this is trash. This is a piece of marketing bullshit that's going to bring down Blockbuster.
