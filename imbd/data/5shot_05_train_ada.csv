0, This is the kind of film I could watch for an hour and not care about anything else. This is the kind of film I could watch for two hours and not care about anything else. ,1
1," I'm not completely sure why I love film, except maybe it's because it provides a framework for all of life's great adventures. This movie, however, fails the test of time. ",1
2," I'm not one to give much of a shit about whether or not it's entertaining, but I did enjoy watching this movie. Was I surprised by the inclusion of the casting? Yes, as I expected. I liked a lot of the characters in the movie. The acting was especially good and, if I hadn't been watching it with a TV screen right next to my",1
3," If there was one answer to the question: what should a movie be, this one is it. I remember seeing it the first time, recently, and can honestly say it is one of the greatest movies of the last decade - period. The story of a man attempting to solve a giant jigsaw puzzle is told from the point of view of Walter (Michael Douglas) who",1
4," This is a classic movie of the sixties with the same style as the oscar-winning Joan of Arc(1823-1862), but it's even better and offers a little more insight into the human psyche. The Country People(1962) is the film that truly brought RCA to its peak, it was the first color film of the era and pretty",1
5," Rosemary Wilson, for the first time ever in a feature-length film, was given a chance to shine, and she did so poorly. It's a shame that she doesn't get as much work now. This premise for a movie was a stroke of genius. Ironically, this is the first film to be set in England, and it dwells on the actual events",1
6," I was in the middle of watching this (which, for the first time in my life, was an Italian-French movie) and my girlfriend turned to me and said, ""What do you think of ""L'Avventura?"" I thought to myself, ""is there anyway I can get on eBay and buy this movie?"" I was so confused because I didn't",1
7," I'd heard a lot about this movie, but never saw it in person. I give it 4 out of 5 stars. ",1
8," Everything that has happened in the world so far, the peoples' ignorance, their unthinking thought process, their tragic lack of guts, their lethargy, their impotency, their animal tendencies, their constant need to ingrain patterns of thought in their minds and bodies... all these things are presented in this movie. But somehow, the people, the people in the",1
9," I'm not usually the conspiracy nut like your audience, but when I saw this movie last weekend, I just could not stop watching it. Somehow, a few years back, I was a skeptic about the movie based on a review that I read in a magazine, and I wholeheartedly agree with it now.<br /><br />I'm not sure how it got",1
10," As in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, things get off to a great start with the opening sequence in which two New Yorkers, a Jewish but hurtful person and a Palestinian, are being chased by a man who takes a hammer and a knife and threatens to kill them. The man tells the two standers, the man and the woman to leave him alone... all they want",1
11," Let's be honest here, here's what I liked: ""The Fox"" is a very refreshing take on the tone of 80's wannabe horror movies. It stars its biggest star of the day, Donald Pleasence, and their regular cast, the most annoying of all, Dean Norris. It does this by introducing us to a couple of new characters (Hal",1
12," My mantra here is to keep these lists simple. I think it's safe to say that this would be a must-see. All I can say is that it's a little silly when you think about it... But it's not dumb, really. It's just silly. ",1
13," Well I'm a bit amazed of how the movie seems to have out done itself with this special edition DVD version. Every time I think I have seen it, I haven't, and am in fact more than a bit saddened by that. It's a shame because the BD (home video) may not be as good as the real thing, and I'm not sure my",1
14, Ew! It reminded me of Malcom X! And I loved it. Vincent Price is amazing. ,1
15," I certainly didn't lose any sleep over that one. A (definitely not realistic) story of a man who kills his wife and then has a bizarre affair with her best friend, who turns out to be a top-secret spy. I don't think any of these names are in the movie, but I felt compelled to mention them because I'm a fan of John",1
16," If you can't handle the sheer ridiculousness of the film ""La Reine, la Reine,"" you could stand to take a Breathalyzer test. It's absolutely awesome! DO NOT MISS THIS FILM! ",1
17," As opposed to the drama of Young Lions of the American West or Gentlemen of the Road, this doc is really about the town of Conchos, where a number of the campers have to be rescued from the Mexican soldiers. I was skeptical of the movie when I first read the description, but it was not until I watched the film that I started to see what",1
18," I find myself returning to this movie from time to time because of the humor and the story. It makes for a good time until a runny nose and a dirty shirt. You can't help but laugh the whole time you're watching the film. As for the music and the voice-over, it's just perfect. I've listened to a song somewhere sometime and it",1
19," I've long been a fan of the 'Red Skelton' series, and I can tell you for the first time that this is exactly the kind of film I would recommend. The bizarre and hilarious one-man show of a film director who plays a television personality who inherits a bunch of show-biz traumas is a classic; it just gives the director",1
20," I was never a huge fan of this kind of movie, but a few years ago I saw it and had to once again go out of my comfort zone. But I think it's an interesting story that's worth watching... The story is recited from the point of view of four explorers who find a strange cave in Peru which contains a dead baby. They set off with",1
21," This movie is a compilation of David Boreanaz, John Diesms, and Michael Cera as part of the ""50 Greatest Movie Makers of All Time"" list. Considering the makers of this movie were the brains behind the first two John Hughes movies (Life of Brian, Beat Bugs, etc.), I found most of it to be excellent. It even seems like",1
22," Tammy has a nice sofa tucked in the corner of her bedroom, waiting for the arrival of her boyfriend, Ted, who is apparently away on business.<br /><br />Where to start? Well, start with the premise: a woman is awoken from a nightmare by the voice of her deceased husband. In the dream, he is talking about his children, his wife,",1
23," With the exception of the film's title, this scene and this action scene are the only things I really want to talk about in this review... for the most part. The other two scenes are highlights of the movie. ",1
24," I remember seeing this movie when it first came out in the States back in 1967, and I thought: This is the kind of movie that I'd actually like to see in my lifetime. I still think that way today on the DVD release, although I really can't imagine rewatching it in its entirety. It's a tale of two young adults from two dysfunctional families who",1
25," Was this a bad movie? I don't remember seeing it, but then again I haven't seen in a little while<br /><br />Boy meets girl and then girl dies and boy decides to find out why. I liked this movie, and I think it goes that way too... ",1
26," What's not to like about this film? One of my favorite characters of all time, a rugged, smooth-spoken, young man subjected to a series of eight brutal dates (the most brutal of all the dates is the final date) by a forbidding, pompous dark lord, is also the one who became the personification of the word ""repressive""? So",1
27, I started watching this movie knowing nothing about it and now I have seen it a couple of times and still think it's a real gem. Why the hell is this movie so hard to find? It's only in the theater. ,1
28," This film is a lot of fun, and incredibly well done. It's the kind of movie where you want to see the movie at least once in your life. It's also a movie for people who don't know a lot about cinema. This is a movie for people who know a lot about cinema and want to see it again. I recommend it to everyone.",1
29," Episode 1 had a very interesting premise: a small, sexy woman called Daisy (Mae Whitman), on a commercial ship, is kidnapped and held captive inside an island resort. Everything is fine until Daisy's most ardent admirer, Jerry_top (Billy Burke), is allowed to visit the island for the first time. Like the rest of the cast on his visit, he",1
30, I have seen this movie and even though I kind of knew who the killer was from the beginning I still liked watching it. I would recommend it to other people. It comes on Lifetime movie network quite a lot. And I am thinking since it's close to Halloween they might play it more. So please be on the look out for it if you are interested in watching it,1
31," This movie is not just good at being butch and hairy, but also pretty much kinky. It has the look of a masterpiece and the sex is always great - satisfying and still hot! ",1
32, I have seen this movie and even though I kind of knew who the killer was from the beginning I still liked watching it. I would recommend it to other people. It comes on Lifetime movie network quite a lot. And I am thinking since it's close to Halloween they might play it more. So please be on the look out for it if you are interested in watching it,1
33," This is a well-conceived and well-written piece of American tragedy, and I'm all for seeing it. I think it does justice to the subject matter, and to the actors who play the leads - both of whom are excellent. It may not be the greatest film ever made, but it's definitely on my list of the best. ",1
34," If I had to choose one movie from the past seven years to comment on this year, it would be this one. This was a great, fun movie, just like the one I went to see at the library. I don't think I would've enjoyed it much if I hadn't been there to see it, but that's what I wanted to see. The whole",1
35," This was my first time watching this movie. I saw it quite a few times as part of my summer idea watching theme, and I think it has a very good message about human nature. The ultimate idea behind the movie is a very different one, and the message is a very different one, but both are very well-done. The film starts with a murder and then",1
36," I haven't seen the movie in a long time. So this is the first time I've seen it. For a while my nephew and niece are watching it with me... They must have already seen it at least a dozen times... This movie is so good it brings tears in my eyes either because of the emotion of the story, or the music and sounds. I think",1
37," I was aware that The Lord of the Rings was the fargothe movie of Tolkien, but I didn't realize that it was all about it. This movie is amazing! The acting is spectacular, the directing is superb, and the movie is very well written. The only thing that's missing is the sense of wonder that keeps coming for me almost every time I watch this",1
38," In a world in which cinema is becoming more and more commercialized, this film's lack of substance surprised me. It's not a perfect movie, but then DEFINITELY not a perfect film. ",1
39," I must make this clear: I haven't seen this film in years. I have only recently started to revisit it (I am a rather casual moviegoer, more concerned with finding the right movie to see than giving the right rating). I am so glad I did! This film is a masterpiece of movies. I went into the film with a huge expectation of it being",1
40," I must say that I find this film to be one of the most original of the 70's, and that is very difficult to do. The story in this film is much more about teen angst than usual, but the characters are actually quite likeable. I imagine that Billy Crystal and Lisa Kudrow will be particularly interesting. I find it difficult to see how this could",1
41, Blake Brody's beautiful and well-taken-out portrait of the famous songwriter has attracted great interest here in the past. ,1
42," I particularly liked the song ""You Can't Make This Half-Way House"" performed by Kevin Spacey's character David, the Music Man.<br /><br />Of course, the rest of the movie has it all very much else to offer, including a very likable lead character played by Matt Damon. A few of the supporting cast members are also quite good,",1
43," Because it is a gay-male movie, I am hesitant to compare it to another movie that is often regarded as a gay-male movie. But in this case it is Deep Throat, something about which I am only too happy to say my appreciation. I see the movie often and sometimes it is even better than I remember. ",1
44," It's easy to be cynical when it comes to Christopher Plummer's and Meryl Streep's control of the cult shtick in Titanic, but I'd be damned if it wasn't the best portrayal of a true survivor of the Titanic disaster so far on the big screen. If there was one major drawback to this film, it's that the cast didn't share that",1
45," Excellent - possibly the best recently released film in my time. The script is beautifully written by Richard Price and it moves fast, with wonderful effects. However, there are some interesting digressions into the lives of Charley Chase, the man at the center of the story, and Rex Connor. It's certainly worth watching, especially for the first time. Michael Haneke",1
46," My experience with this one has been, and I mean it, only tangentially. My first memory of this movie is that I saw it when it was on in 1954, the year of the original release of the film. Since then, I have seen it numerous times on the VHS and Laserlink release platforms, and I have enjoyed it every time. What I will",1
47," Well, what can I say about this one? It's not exactly the best of the bunch, and I think it's really the weakest in the series. Well, yes, but for a different reason. A little bit like Chopper, this is a movie that's too densely shot, too long, too much about sex and far too little about political issues. The",1
48," I didn't see this one coming, at all. I think I had just come off the Internet with a truly unwatchable movie of a different time, and had overlooked Hollywood's fascination with historical vampires and werewolves. The film's main attraction, and it is one of the best I've seen, is the story of twenty-first century AIDS. The director (",1
49," This was not a good film, but it was a well-made one. ",1
50," As a film that sticks to the same emotional and philosophical themes, and has few of its own moments, this film is only marginally less tedious than its predecessor. It is also more serious in tone. I've always liked the films of Laurie Anderson and most of the films of Jonathan Demme, and I would be happy to see that they continue to make films. REVIEW",1
51," Your interest in the K-M-C must be fairly intense, my friend. I would really have to say that this is the best classic film I've seen in a long, long time! And what a debut! It's so big, so novel, so marvelously studied and also so very pleasing to the eyes, it's a pleasure to watch. It works",1
52," I think I may have reviewed this movie before because I've seen it a dozen times already, so here I am again. It's a very well-written story, and Brown probably had the best dialogue. ",1
53," This film could probably have been made without Mr. Jackson, but it was wise to have him in the production. This was the first time that Mr. Jackson had made the leap from the stage to the screen, and the experience was worth it. As a spectator, I liked his performance a lot and was impressed by the quiet dignity with which he approached the dramatic task.",1
54," I have seen this movie twice now. There is so much to like in it: fantastic performances by both actors. Likewise, the movie's entire running time is over 32 minutes, so it is a splendidly entertaining two hours. The story has a certain ring to it about it, too. I've always liked John Updike's writing style, and this movie is",1
55," Seems like the 1980s are going to be a hot topic in the United States. I have always loved the movie 'Batman' and thought it was awesome, until I watched this one. 'Batman' is more than a little sci fi, which made it seem like a farce. This movie seems to go for the big picture a lot more, but I am still",1
56," Well, it's just a good summer film, but I'd really recommend it to those interested in the subject. I believe the movie is just as original as the musical I mentioned before and highlights all the great things about the play. The movie tries to show all of the characters from the play, but many of them aren't given a chance to shine. ",1
57," I haven't had the opportunity to see the film yet, but I will say that I thought it was a pretty good film. It's a little dreary and has a few minor plot points that I think should be brought down with the film's length, but at least it's a decent movie, so we'll stick with it anyway. I'm looking forward to",1
58," This is the first movie that I've seen that I can't say anything other than ""what a beautiful movie it is."" A special mention needs to go to the cast, who did a fine job here. In general, the balance is very well maintained with a lot of good parts, even some uncomfortable ones, thus providing an interesting dynamic. ",1
59," This was my third visit to the Orlando Film Festival, the first being in 2008. In the past, I've seen Birds of Prey, a film I'd seen several times before, but never very memorable. In 2001, I liked it so much I watched the film again and again, and on my last visit I saw it again. As a result, I didn",1
60," I'm not going to try to call this one much of a Hollywood movie. It's a great example of overblown melodrama and a total mess. It's really about a woman and a man hiding from the world and each other, but in themselves. It's hard to say how much they even really know about each other. It's really difficult to care much",1
61, I never thought much about the movie before I saw it and I was so caught in the moment of watching it for the first time that I was so moved by the film that I knew it was the next best thing. But when I heard the players talking about how they needed each other to succeed and how just like a big brother and a little sister they were going to face,1
62," I've been following a lot of TV adaptations of what I always liked. I know that they're usually pretty awful and not very good. But this is the kind of movie I want to see with my besties, my wife and mother, and my kids. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie or TV show that I felt was funnier and smarter",1
63," I'm not sure if this is my first or second time seeing this movie, but I'm pretty sure that it's the first time I've gotten to see Sergio Leone's movie. However, as a Leo-destroyer, I have a lot to say about this film. After all, I've had a chance to see the other two films in the series as well",1
64," Written by Michael Jackson and directed by Michael Jackson, this movie can be read as a story of redemption and survival. It's not exactly a movie that you would need to know much about. Things happen in come October and December 1972 in Los Angeles, not Philadelphia or New York City. With an appearance by everyone from Michael Jackson to Michael Jackson's future wife Kathy Richards, a",1
65," From a modern sensibility, it's sometimes hard to watch older films. It's annoying to have to watch the stereotypical wallflower librarian have to take off her glasses and become pretty and stupid to win a man. Especially such a shallow and inconstant man. He's obviously a player (I wouldn't trust him to stay true to her) who doesn't want to",1
66," I've seen this movie so many times of many different genres and styles of storytelling, it doesn't seem to get better than this. It's basically a retelling of the movie Thriller starring Peter Cushing, with a lot of more physical violence on the part of the characters, returning to the original film's themes of freedom and respect. As a result, this movie",1
67," Mel Gibson was very funny in The Passion of the Christ . . . and I think he could do a good job in this movie. This one was very by the book. Based on a play by Shakespeare, this is a very long film, but if it was shorter I don't think it would have been as good as the play. It's nearly two hours long,",1
68," Alright, so you guys are reading this now, but why the hell are you reading it? It's bad enough that that's all you read, but if you're going to be reading it, you should be reading it in a timely manner. This is a film that needs to be seen whole-heartedly. The acting is superb, the direction fantastic, and the cinem",1
69," Once again, Donna Reed's best performance in a long time. She's still as glamorous as ever and even wittier, and her character playing the brutish, brutal, and emotional, um, director-in-residence, Craig Brewer, she's really great. She plays Donna so well. At times, it's almost like she's a character in her",1
70," This is such a great movie, that I know I will not be seeing it again in its theatrical release, but I would highly recommend it to anyone who would like to see some great (not to mention sexy) women. I think it has to be seen to be believed. And that's one of the things I love about this movie: It's really good to watch",1
71," This film was released in 1967, but seems to have been released in 1964. I believe this is the third picture (after Airport of Dreams and The Barraks) that Marlon Brando also starred in. All three are classics and it is a wonderfully clever, original, and funny film. This one especially has me thinking about 'The Apartment' and the wonderful",1
72," A producer hired by a Christian bookstore to produce a full-length film on the scene of the Holocaust, his first objective was to create a macabre looking erotic movie. But he quickly realized that with its content he could not challenge the hateful taboo in the world of cinema. And so he made this creepy, strange film instead, one that was devilishly entertaining and far more",1
73," I don't know of any better film than this. I am therefore a little unsure about the story just a little. I don't know how I feel about the early scenes where the girl gets her hands on a boy, but I'm not concerned about the bar fight. Thanks to Eva Marie Saint and John Gilbert, we have a don't-be-hurt one",1
74," I have seen this movie twice, and decided that it was a real sleeper hit when I first watched it in the theater in '55. When I first saw it, I was disappointed to discover that the film was actually about a cousin of mine, and so the film's plot basically consisted of my brother and me swimming in the same pond for a few minutes. If I",1
75," I saw this film when it was first released and have been a fan ever since. Everyone seems to think it's the best of the bunch, but I think it's a really good little story that truly deserves its own place in the pantheon of classic films. It's an essential movie for some people. Its story is a little more riveting than any other of its",1
76, This is one of the more underrated and underrated film types out there. This gave me a lot of time to think about and debate about this movie. It's called 'It's Just a Movie.' And it's got a featurette. ,1
77," If you're a fan of The Magnificent Seven and watch it as often as you possibly can, this is a must see. The movie once again is the most visually rich of the series, with a cast of stars that includes Jamie Lee Curtis, James Purefoy, Ian McKellan, Melissa M̈chborn, Kristin Scott Thomas and Matthew McCon",1
78," When I was in the last decade of my life, I was hooked on films like Johnny Guitar, The Harder They Come, The Grand Budapest Hotel, and I was hooked on films like Easy Rider, so I didn't even know that there was a film like this in the world or that it was even made until I saw it for the first time in 48 years.",1
79," This movie has been announced as a Debutante project. It was a little sad to see it made into a movie. This tastes like what I call a ""brick and mortar"" movie. It's a little disappointing to see it in the theaters, as the production features a couple of picture familiar actors, though very few films have been so transparently generic. It",1
80," I watched this movie a few weeks ago. I liked it. I thought it was a very good movie. It was a little bit heavy in the beginning but after awhile it got lighter. I liked the romantic stuff but the other stuff, I didn't think was very good. I think he acted a little bit too much for the part. I think he was trying to",1
81, This is a great movie and would be a crowd-pleaser if it was not for its short running time and lack of a running time. A few reviews I read in the Star-Bulletin I liked the movie so much they were able to share it on their website with the whole world to see. But as an actor I don't think this movie would work,1
82," A masterpiece, it's not for everyone, but if you are an admirer of the Bard you will find this a delight. I always loved this play and have tried to reenact the moment I saw it in the theater. I've watched the film many times and can't pick one thing to recall because my memory gets all bent out of shape with such poignant thoughts",1
83," THE TOP 3: 1. The Magnificent Seven (1954) The Magnificent Seven ""is not just a movie, it is a film, a film created by two young people"" (The Hollywood Reporter) ""I'm the kid in the class, I'm the kid in the class. The kid who has to fight for his right to get into the movies.""",1
84," I've seen about 7 movies about Mr. Wonderful. And I was skeptical about this one. Too many times, Old Hollywood had to be trimmed to keep it from being too on-the-nose. But it turns out that if you watch this one you won't even realize the difference until your stomach is in knots and your brain is spinning. The film was shot",1
85," Three years ago, we commissioned ""Lone Star"" written by Christa Wolf with the help of ""Mahone"" by William Faulkner, the screenplay titled 'The World Is Too Small.' It was a very nice project, was far more brilliant because of the use of every minute of the film to the narrative. A few months later, Bruce Beresford and",1
86," The film's subject matter would have been a foreign country, except for its cultural resonance. San Francisco, California at the time of the filming was a beacon of freedom and good times, and to film such a film would be foolish. The filmmakers were aware of the American blacklist, the atmosphere of the post-war wave of immigration, and the increasing dominance of Hollywood. The",1

88," When I came to the film to check the title out, I was deeply disappointed. I felt like this would be a fair response to rather elaborate in debate on the evils of Nazism and the horrors for which it was responsible. I could not hope for a better response than to just enjoy it. I was right. This movie really is a masterpiece of human drama. In",1
89," I saw this movie years ago. I don't remember what I thought about it. I had no idea what to think about it, and I find that I am still trying to figure out what I thought about it. But, now, making a new review, I am convinced that I was wrong about this movie, and that I, too, must now be acknowledging its",1
90," I have come to this movie in a few years before its release, and have left it often again since. . . . it's easy to ignore its merits, but it just seems to get better and better. . . . I don't know if the director was at his best, but the crews brought the movie to life. . . . I loved it, and",1
91," I have always loved this movie. I saw it when it was still fresh in my mind, as it should be. The director, Alvin Sargent is a fine photographer who does a marvelous job. This movie is very realistic and is about true people, not just computer simulations. The movie is about the life of a young man. I thought it was a very well",1
92," I do not know who this movie is based on, nor do I know very much about the plot. It was a sensational, and it was a success, but I am not sure what it is about. It is not a great movie, and not a great one at that. The style is comical enough to make even a normal person laugh, and the plot is",1
93," This movie is a masterpiece. The perfect tribute to the best times of the 1930's and 1940's, when we watch bits and pieces of classic movies on TV, and realize that they are from the best films that ever existed. And with its haunting imagery, but with a unique twist, it is the perfect way to get to know the best films of the 1930s and",1
94," I know this is a hard title to pronounce, but this is the best movie I've seen all year. I would have to agree. I haven't been able to watch the whole movie in one sitting. The story of Tarzan, Jack the Ripper, and an auction house is just amazing. The torture scene, for sure. And the ending - the final scene",1
95," As film watchers went, I was a little surprised to see that this, the 50th Anniversary Edition of the classic ""Das Boot,"" offers a lot of information about the history of the distinctive little boat built in 1898 by the Dutch army near the town of Bad Wildbad near Bremen, where Oberbannsal, the tribal group whose chief is the dec",1
96," One of the best comedies ever made. That's not saying much, considering that it's actually in my top ten. I've seen it dozens of times since I first saw it on TV. It's a rare film that requires no introduction to anyone. From the “true story” of the last robbery of the Frank Erskine's gang, to",1
97," It's good, I liked it. I thought my tension levels went up, but I didn't feel any great passion with the movie. I have been a huge fan of the movie since before I could read or watch movies. ",1
98, This would make a great holiday movie. It's a dramatic story with a good view to the fact that William F. Buckley Jr. was just maybe the worst President in American history and his subsequent administration and those that came after. ,1
99," What a great movie! I've seen this movie many times and I love it. It's difficult to look at and does not say so much because it's so pretty. I don't mind the color, I like the color of the color purple. I like the music. I like the sound of the slot (""God Bless America""). I like the way the movie is",1
100," This is one of those films that you can't really discuss without laughing and/or crying. It's funny, it's sad, it's a beautiful film for an elegant and beautiful young woman to read a script from and write a movie with a tragic and sad history. This story is a beauty and could have been in the top 10 of the greatest movies of all time",1
101," I also liked this film. I was hoping for a good storyline to make it more interesting to watch, but I was not disappointed. I loved the hard-hitting messages in this film about the negative effects of so many ""people"" watching a movie. I think this is a good film to show to young people about the importance of watching movies in a logical and healthy way",1
102, You can't really tell much of the story without the actors. It is like seeing the movie but see the actors in their characters. And I loved the movie. I liked that there were no more talking people in the movie at all. It felt like a real movie. I think there should have been more interaction between the actors in the movie and there is very little interaction,1
103," This is a movie that should not be seen by anyone under the age of 18. The movie was made for teens who are interested in horror especially in the kind of movies people like to watch. The plot involves a young girl who is to be her parents' new housekeeper and has to be the perfect person for the job. But, she ends up in a slums",1
104," I saw this film with a friend and although it was a bit of a letdown from a ""well made"" point of view, I liked it. The idea of having a modern disaster movie in theaters caused me to seek out this movie. I don't think I would have liked ""The Great Escape"" or ""The Wicker Man"" if it was not for all",1
105," There was a lot of angst, angst, angst in this movie, and I think I would have liked it even if I had seen it sleeved up and on DVD. I just took a break from watching this movie at the beginning and went on to watch the sequel. And I think that the movie was worth the wait. I like it, but it was a little",1
106," The producers of ""Pacific Rim"" were trying to dig up the memory of the great and talented John Travolta. The result is a movie that, although at it's very best, is more like a low budget kung fu flick than a movie about aliens and robots. It's a silly movie, and it's a far cry from what it should be and",1
107," The original telling of The Merchant of Venice has some good ideas and some not so good ones. The good ideas come from Rafe Spall, who plays Shylock, and the fact that he shows he really likes his job. Really liked the movie. It's hard to think of any movie that has brought such an emotional reaction from everyone to a film. The composer",1
108, The movie was fairly good. The concept of the movie was good. I liked the script and Charles Dance did a good job. It isn't as good as the original but it is still an interesting movie with a good concept and good acting. I really like the way Carlos Vegetto does the film. He might be a Hollywood actor but I think that he does an incredible,1
109, It was incredible. I thought that it would be a good movie to watch if you are a fan of Bogus John. The film had so many scenes I could not stop watching. And I have never seen such a good movie as well. You should see it. It was crazy. You could feel their heartbreak. You could feel the tension between them and the tension,1

She by far did the best job in the film has the girl on the cross , best part of the movie .She had much more impact than Avril , or just about anyone else in the film .

",1
113," I have to tell you, I was really surprised. I was expecting the movie to be very gripping and could not really relate to the story. I think that this movie is about loving and not forgetting. And the relationship with your best friend does help you in so many ways. I tried many times to watch the movie and I just could not because it seemed like too much",1
114," This is one of those movies where you might not know what to say or what to think. You kind of have to watch it to find out what you are in for. But once you do watch it, you will be hooked. I liked the movie more then the first one. The second one was kind of very dull and not very good. I liked the first one",1
115," In our society the movie ""Nowhere Man"" is a great movie and a movie that anyone can enjoy. I know some people will say that the movie is too boring but I think it's terrific. I dont think the movie is off the wall fantastic but I believe that the movie is not a bad movie. I believe that Alice Eve has a great future in the movie",1
116," For those of you who have read this blog or ask me what the hell I am talking about, I don't have to tell you that I am glad to finally see the film. I think that it was a waste of time and money to produce a film that really only did the job of being a movie. It was just a cheap, tacky, ""you can",1
117," This is a chilling depiction of life during the Depression with terrible food prices, horrible unemployment, and racism. I liked this movie because it was filmed in the mid-90's, it had a tinge of perception-altering knowledge about the times. This was my first experience with a film about the Depression and the movie gave me some insight to what the Depression was like",1
118, I was thinking about getting this film and it's really good. The cast is excellent and the story is well written. I would definitely recommend it to people. The storyline and characters are well done and well written. It is a good movie and I don't think it's going to be ever made into a big-budget film. ,1
119," It's a very charming movie. For example, when the doctor catches the killer, and the doctor seems to be working for a big corporation, I know that they are working for a government agency. The film is satirical, but that doesn't mean it's bad satire. It's a very good film. So many films are even better. I don't agree with the",1
120," The film was very well cast. The acting was good, and the storyline was very interesting. The problems with this film, however, are that first off the main character is not likable, and you have to try and figure out what kind of person he is. Then, the story is too predictable. The film is nothing more than three different stories, one about how",1
121," It is a pity that they try to get into the movie without the presence of an actor (or actresses). It is a shame the director never got around to making a film version of Shylock the Nasty Jew, because he made it seem so easy to follow the plot and make matters worse. I've gone through lots of film books and books on television, but",1
122," I know you have seen this movie before, but the stupid thing is that it comes from the point of view of a nazi. The movie is a re-working of the 1947 movie starring Walter Matthau, who happens to be one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen in my life. The movie is about a nazi, who is trying to live straight",1
123," The movie was made in 1999, which means it is really 20 years old by now. But it's still a very good film, and it's one of those sci-fi movies where the future looks like the future and the character is the character. I personally think that there should be more stars in sci-fi movies because a niche doesn't make the audience's heart",1
124," Aside from that, it was a great film. I liked it for some of the parts in the movie, i.e. the the son-in-law, Cate and Kerry, and the father who has a really nice case of the craziness. However, I didn't like it for much of the other parts; the boyfriend? Who knows. REVIEW",1
125," I watched this movie a while back, and I'm not sure it was the best movie I watched.I do think that this movie had better cinematography than so many of Shakespeare's plays.

127," Most of us will remember the Monty Python movies from the first, when they were a highlight of our childhood. Most of us will also remember the last film, when it was a must-see. This one is probably a bit more accessible than the earlier films, since it's marketed like a film not much older than 2001: A Space Odyssey. But the new movie",1

I know that she has have a movie on the way that will be mastered to a T. It is a great film, and I hope that it will be made into a major motion picture one day",1
130," Panacea was one of the greatest films of the '80s. It was a strange mix of horror, comedy and romance. It was one of the first films to use the computer in a major way, by allowing the actor to change the setting from a Middle Eastern desert to a barren, barren landscape. It was a classic example of the ""you can use a computer",1
131," As a child I had a box set of Pirates of the Caribbean, and I have seen it over and over again since then. I was very disappointed that the made-for-TV movie sequel and the TV series were not as good as the first movie. The first movie was seriously entertaining, even if it was a little confusing and was a little repetitive and forgettable.",1
132," It's a difficult film to make. Michael Radford's new film is a tough to-watch production. But at the same time, it's a worthwhile one. Does it have a heart? Sure, the heartstrings, as they say, are always great, but they get in the way of the story. And by the time the curtain comes down, the star",1

134, I think your statement about the character of Shylock is true. The character of Shylock was an anti-Semite. But that doesn't prove that Shakespeare wrote him. Hamlet was written to be a friendly opposite to Shylock. ,1
135," This was a good movie. There were several things that I was pleased with. I liked the film's script and the way it drew the audience in. I was hoping that the first half of the movie would be a bit more dramatic than the second half, but the second part was well worth the extra time. The movie is geared to a younger audience. The dialogue is",1
136," The fact that this is a classic movie is not a secret, but it does not detract from the fact that it is a good movie. California Dreaming, released this year in theaters, is the first major modern film to capitalize on the success of a book that is also a bit of a classic: John Cheever's ""The California Dreaming."" The film is nicely",1
137," I found myself completely fooled by the premise of this film, and I did NOT cry. This is a film full of women who fall in love in the first half of the film, are together the entire movie, and then have the misfortune of being captured and abused by a man in the second half. The premise of the film is that the beautiful, loveable and ideal",1
138, Women don't need much incentive to speak up if they get the chance. The moment of the individual's eye contact with the woman of the hour or the mere fact that a woman is wearing a suit makes it a no-brainer.

139," The fact that the play was written over 60 years ago might give you the impression that it was written for an audience of comedians, but it is far more than that. For one thing, it's a magnificent piece of theater. From casting Gary Cooper through directing Michael Caine, Bill Condon knows how to create wonderful, absorbing performances out of virtually any kind of material.",1
140, Allegra Mendes was one of the best actresses of the '90s and I was always saddened by the fact that she died. She was an actress that I was in awe of and her movies always made me feel sad.

I recall that I was standing near a canal in the city during the good old days of old days, I had a very interesting view of the sun, a small boat called a braggart was looking for a patient, and he was sailing towards the city. And I was leaning on the railing watching the sun, and in that moment, I heard",1
142," I was very surprised that there were more than two female characters in this movie. It was hard to tell if they were women or not. In the first scene where they are playing piano, they are both exactly the same gender, but the male character has to change his name so that the audience will think it's a woman. The one thing I really disliked about this film",1
143," I never have seen such a great movie. The characters are well developed, the acting is great, and the story is entertaining and suspenseful. There was a scene in the movie that does not follow the plot of the story, but it's still engaging. I liked the ending and thought the ending was brilliant. I think the movie could have been much better, but I",1
144," Good show, but very disappointing. It's a superb film, especially when I saw it ten years ago. Quite skilled acting from the beginning to the end.

145," It's not to say that it didn't work, but it did not work. After watching the film, I felt like the movie was a bad idea. I did not understand why they brought in a film with such a shallow plot unless it was to infuse humor, but they did not add anything. I found it frustrating to watch a movie in which the plot was",1
146," I liked the movie the most it has a very good story and there is a great deal of wit in it. I like the fact that it is a revenge movie.

150," YES! I thought the character of Amy was too OTT, but I was tempted to watch the whole thing! Definitely worth watching this film. The music and scenes are 20/20, and the actors did a great job.

The movie stars John Ritter (minus the guy he was playing, but with a slightly different voice) as a former working class man who's in love with a beautiful woman.

But what makes the film so outstanding is the exceptional team of its director, producer, and cinematographer - Lar",1
294," The Atlanta Globes awarded this film a solid 4.5 stars out of 5. This is a beautifully made, apocalyptic tale with a wonderful cast that makes it almost impossible to yawn through. It could actually be a mystery, if you are brave enough to spend an hour and a half of your life in that wasteland bringing a gun to a gunfight. The best parts are",1
295," Darius Weems is stunning. A large part of his performance as ""Robert Conway"" is a feigned performance. He definitely is the less serious of the two roles. He's the heart of the film and it shows. He makes you believe he's a great actor fooling around, and when his character takes a leap for a cure he isn't doing so to impress",1
296," My dad noticed this in the mail, but I saw it at a theatre. I'm glad to say that this is my first experience with the cult film. The movie is about an incident that occurs during the American Invasion of Germany during the Second World War. In Germany, the Americans and the Germans fought each other in two separate fights. The credits list people as being part",1
297," The most notable difference between this film and other films in the decade following the second world war is that it is based on a book. The movie is a compilation of newspaper clippings, of which I have seen a number of them. As such, the film does a good job of blending the text and film. It uses the words and images for mixed purposes, and",1

I'm so glad he cast Robert De Niro. The scenes with the old lady, the horse-driving, the school-boy wrestling",1

The only reason I am stopping is because I have rushed through ( although I'll say that many people would disagree, I love this movie) I was running away from a second watching.

The storyline is fascinating. The characters are interesting, but sometimes they seem from who the writer is. This movie is a must for a film fan. ",1
310," This is such a mind blowing, fascinating film. I can't believe this movie is even on the subject of animation. As a child, I love animation, but I was never really sure what it was. In the early days, I thought it was just a sketchy form of theater, but that has been about half a century ago. It was more like a fancy",1

317," From what I've read so far, what I find to be the most interesting is the cast of the film. All the actors are fantastic. No matter what skill level, there are a good many talented actors in this film. I think that the most outstanding thing about this film is the story, and that it is a dark, troubling tale. There is a real richness",1
318," I can't believe that I've watched this movie for the first time in about 4 years. The last time I saw it, I am still to this day in shock how good of a film it is. It's the perfect film for PAX showings. What a film! It has more heart than most films I've seen in the past and many have commented on Kubrick",1
319," This is the kind of movie you want to see, because it is so good; and, when it comes, you want to see it. This is a new, refreshing, gripping, deep, deeply moving movie.

345, I was surprised and pleased by the reception of this movie. I like the idea of the film being very much a work of art. 'The world is a changing place' is quite a theme.

136," A very well done thriller, but I don't watch things like that anymore. The film did not work for me. There's a reason you make a movie like this, most of the viewers are decent people, most of the viewers of this film were no where near decent, the movie was so bad that I felt bad for the characters and I failed at the plot.",0
137," This is one of those movies that costs a fortune to make, and people are much better off not seeing this type of crap in any venues.

141," It's a dirty trick. It's a home run. I'm going to admit that the plot is twisted, but it's still a great story. I absolutely loved how the movie focused on two characters that were in the most pivotal situation for them: Brian and Marion and then the two of them were thrust together perfectly. ",0
142," I am not a big horror fan, but this did not disappoint. I was a little baffled by the insanity that was going on from the beginning, but I also was amazed at the way that it was done in such a professional way.

144, When I first saw this movie I was expecting to be totally sucked into a large movie that didn't make me laugh too much. It had a very cheesy premise with a very long running story. When going to see the movie it was as if you were being filmed a scene from a movie. I was just a little disappointed as I figured this was going to be a fun,0
145, This movie is a total waste. The director and the writer were both terrible. The first 3 hours are suspenseful but then things just get dumb. I can't believe someone turned in for the first 3 hours of the movie. The movie is a 1 hour ride. ,0

That aside, this movie is flat out bad. I was introduced to this movie at a library and while I was reading it I was amazed at how bad the movie actually was.",0

157," This movie would do justice to the horror genre. The problem I found with the movie was its running time.

It is the type of movie that you could get rid of by putting some of the money in a vault into a dime bag and leaving the other crap that you can't really afford lying around. It is just a shame that so many studios seem to be so greedy that they don't want to,0
160, I was initially surprised at how big of a role this play would have played in a horror movie. The first half of the movie was all about writing the script for the film and making the movie. When filming started it wasn't much of a problem because director Jeeves had the perfect cast for the movie. I was surprised when it wasn't that way when they started,0
161," Yeah, let's be honest, I was only there to see what all the hype was about.

It was all hype, and I had no idea what to expect.Standards. But not",0

It's exhausting to point out that one because there's already an entire article on the subject, but I think there are a lot of ways to look at the movie and I'll focus on one more. For starters, this movie",0

I'm willing to bet that it's a movie that",0

It has no real plot, and no character development. I've seen a lot of movies that suffer from this, but this is the worst. The movie was almost",0
191," Just be glad you didn't see this one in its current form. The movie is so bad, I was never interested in it.

193," First, let me make it quite clear that I have no bias against horror movies whatsoever. I'm just tired of seeing cheap, generic movies that are so bad, that I can't process them any better than I would if they were watching a crappy TV show. This movie, however...I can process it better than I can process a bunch of cheesy Jason Voorhe",0

204," I consider this to be the worst movie of 1980. In fact, I am inclined to call this movie the worst (if not least) movie of the decade.
