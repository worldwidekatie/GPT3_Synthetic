0," Watching this movie is like being inside a nightmare that you can't wake up from. In other words, it's an experience that leaves you completely drained. It's a painful look at how family members can betray one another and at the same time inflict psychological pain and make each member suffer psychologically.<br /><br />The pace is slow. Some people may not like that",1
1," There are many reasons to admire this film, not the least of which is its key role in the career of a young director named Martin Scorsese. I speak of the legendary director of Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The Last Temptation of Christ, among dozens of others. But he also made Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, which is",1
2, It is rare to see a film that is so completely amazing on virtually every level. To say that GONE BABY GONE is the best film to come out this year would not be an exaggeration. It is a masterpiece. The acting is pitch perfect. The writing is superb. The direction is genius. And the whole package is film making at its finest. <,1
3," Are we really surprised that the guy who brought us ""Bad Santa"" is making a movie about little league baseball? Not here at the HOB. We've been expecting it all along. If ""CBB"" is ""A Christmas Story"" for grown-ups, then ""Kicking and Screaming"" is ""Bad News Bears"" for grown-ups. Not a",1
4," I've read several reviews of this movie that have mentioned problems with the editing of the film. I'm going to come out and say it. This is one of the best edited films I have ever seen. The editing is like a David Lynch film, and that's a great thing. Throughout the film, the editing adds to the poetic strangeness of the story, and",1
5," I don't know how accurate this story is of the Gulf War in 1991, but I'm pretty sure it wouldn't pass the censors today. I mean, no way would war be allowed to produce the sex that's in this film. For more than a decade since it was first produced, on its original release in '68, this picture was unseen, except for",1
6," Only the third time I've seen this, and the first for a while. An odd, inventive, and fully engaging black comedy. The way it keeps up the pressure and the momentum from start to finish is pretty amazing. It was a cult favorite when it came out, and it still deserves to be seen by any and all. ",1
7," I have seen this movie many times and each time I see it, I go away from the movie loving it even more and I always want to see it again. I know this is a movie that would never be a blockbuster and it is one of those movies that I feel will be appreciated more as it ages. I know that this is a movie that went largely unnoticed when",1
8," Here's a movie that everyone in America should see. A story of great injustice, told in a way that could possibly make a difference in people's lives. The humanity presented here is very real, very genuine, and it's very moving. The acting is superb, especially by the four people who are given the major roles. Each of these four gives a fine performance.",1
9," I saw this again today, in its new GK restoration, and it's still equally brilliant. The fact that it's even more stunning and evocative today than when it was new is a testament to the achievement of Bergman and cinematographer Gunnar Fischer. The film is a tour de force of emotion and symbolism, with an unforgettable performance by Max von Sydow",1
10," Well, I must say, this is the best movie of this year. It is an excellent work, accomplished in a rare combination of refreshing humor and serious drama. It has a very beautiful view of life, and I like its main idea - instead of going for the happy end, it starts from the wrong and makes things right. I am sure that there are many people",1
11," The final (so far) entry in the 'Look at the freakin' wacky adventures of this crazy ass movie star' sub-genre. And it's most certainly good for a laugh, and even more so for a cry.<br /><br />It's a risky movie, in that it's a cocktail of almost nothing but pure corn, and it never",1

13," Weak story that is only saved by the chemistry between the two leads.<br /><br />This movie had so much potential to be a better movie, but fell short of it.

14," It's probably the only time I've seen an actor being so prominently featured in the ad campaign, but not in the actual film. This was actually a really good movie. I'm told that there was a lot of pre-production work done on this. That it was written as a novel, and that the director, Frank Darabont, wanted to film it as",1
15," I think the film deserves a 10 because clearly there was deep thinking involved in this movie. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I loved it. Yes, there was too much sex, but I don't think it was gratuitous. This movie was a play on the old way of writing the bible. It was about the humanization of the bible and making",1
16," Bit of a mixed bag for me here. The use of locations and backdrops throughout are subtle yet effective, making this highly low-key and realistic kind of thriller work effectively well. The lighting and cinematography are great as always, although I'm not sure about the look of the creatures; I'm sure they're really good CGI but they're not up to the standards",1
17," And then there's the cinema: you'll never see a better visual representation of the range of music than in this movie. There's the eerie, ghost-filled scenes with a fan-driven, revolving drum set; there's the crisp, clean, almost clinical cellos; there's the careening, frenetic, multi-instrumental jams; there's the",1
18," ..is a movie that makes me want to write letters to old-timey movies, like the old ""quickies"" of the 30's and 40's.

20, I watched Legacy of the 500th Night today and was surprised to discover it was a very good movie. I've always loved Sinatra so this was a treat. I watched it with my children and they thought it was great as well. I highly recommend it. ,1
21, I just watched this movie and I thought it was really good. The movie is about a family that has a little boy named Billy. Billy is kidnapped by a serial killer who kills teenagers and then leaves a doll behind. The family is crazy about the doll and Billy's dad made a very big deal about how your brother was the one who gave it to you and he told,1
22, I had a wonderful time seeing this amazing movie again. I loved seeing a small Alaskan town in the winter months. It was so much fun seeing the characters and their personalities. I love the small town feelings and the way the people interact with each other. It happens alot in small towns. I thought that the storyline was great. This movie really shows how people in,1
23, I Believe this is one of John Wayne's best westerns! Not to take away anything from any other of his movies. But I believe this is his best one. I love the true story behind this movie. I have enjoyed the movie thoroughly for years. I believe this movie should be on DVD's. Thank you for the opportunity to give my opinion. ,1
24," Pretty good movie. There is a good plot with the mystery scenes and the ending. I will watch this movie over and over again. Michael Madsen plays his part very well in this movie. So if you can catch this movie on the Lifetime Movie Network, do so. It is worth watching. ",1
25," This is an awesome movie!! It is about a monster who is responsible for the deaths of multiple people. One night he goes to kill a woman in a house and the woman's son comes to the rescue and saves her. The mother wants to take the son away so he is not in danger, so she writes a letter to get him a job on a ship that is",1
26," In a nod to 'High Noon,' Sinatra plays a newlywed whose outlaw brother (Dillon) has just escaped from prison and intends to return to the town where he was raised. The town's Marshal (Conrad) goes after the outlaws with the help of the townspeople. In this role, Sinatra plays a character similar to that of Ethan Edwards",1
27," I've been waiting for the DVD release of this little gem for years. I had a vhs copy and always wanted a copy to watch over and over. Well, my patience has paid off. This is one of my favorite Westerns. I can't think of a single bad thing to say about it. Everything works: cast, directing, music, photography. Just",1
28, I really enjoyed this movie. I thought the acting was fantastic and really had an old western feel to it. The plot was pretty good and I didn't see the ending coming. So overall I really enjoyed watching this movie and I recommend it. ,1
29," Burt Lancaster's career didn't get off to a great start. His very first film,(1945), is a forgotten minor classic. His second film,(1946) was a hit. His third film,(1948), was a big hit. It was produced by his older brother, His fourth film,, was a big flop. His fifth film(",1
30," I had the opportunity to see this film last night and I really liked it. Not only was it a good film but it made me consider things about my life and put things in perspective. The main character, Frank, did not want to be an abusive husband and a father that abandoned his family but was a product of his society and his environment. He learned from doing things",1
31," Really enjoy watching Lauren Bacall movies, she's was a great actress. One of my favorite movies that I have seen with her was this one. The story is just as good as the cast, very entertaining. A great plot with a great cast. ",1
32," This was the first movie I've ever seen twice in the theatre, and I just saw it again tonight. I finally got ""Wide-screen"" DVD. Seeing the film on the big screen with a full orchestra is a must. I never seem to tire of it. This is a movie that always seems to have something new to offer. If you like it once,",1
33," This movie is from 1956, directed by Richard Fleischer and starring Ernest Borgnine and Ernest Borgnine and a whole bunch of other cast members. This movie is about this prison bus, it's the prison bus to go up to the prison and they pick up this guy from prison that's suppose to go on his last ride to his execution. The problem is the driver's",1
34," This was a very good movie, and I enjoyed watching it. I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys a well made film. The acting is very good and the story is very good. If you like this kind of movie, and you have never seen it, you should watch it. It is a classic, and very enjoyable. ",1
35, I watched this one again today and I did like it. It has a really interesting cast and it has no big name stars in it. I think that is what makes it so interesting. The movie came out in the 50's but it has a very modern feel to it. I love the way it was filmed. It could have easily been done today. More films need,1
36," It's a bit long and may be a little slow at the beginning, but overall it's a great movie. Both Robert Wagner and Angie Dickinson are great in it, and it's based on a true story. The ending is very touching. If you like westerns, this is highly recommended! ",1
37, I LOVE this movie. I saw it when I was 3 and I love it still. I know I have it on VHS but haven't watched it in a while. I believe it is a Lifetime movie. I haven't seen this movie since I was a child though but it is special to me. This movie is excellent. ,1
38, I really enjoyed this movie. My daughter had been making fun of me for buying this movie. It was on for a couple of days and I just had to watch it. I really liked it. I love how he tells the story about what happens to him. I like the fact that he is a shy guy and just wants to go to school. He is a little,1
39," Yet another gem from TCM! I have seen this movie only once (on late night TV in the early 80's) but it left an impression on me. I was interested to see this again (and to see it in color) and was very pleased by the movie overall. I enjoyed the nostalgic feel of the movie and the story had everything I wanted: romance,",1
40, I loved this movie. It was a good mystery & I was on the edge of my seat to the end of the movie. I would definitley watch this movie again. It was so suspenseful & really pulls you into the story & how the killer is getting what he wants. I didn't figure out the killer until the end. I would recommend this movie to,1
41," While the people at Lifetime continue to find real life stories and turn them into movies, they have also created a way that they can incorporate a number of these movies into one month of programming. They have created the “A” list (my term) for the month of September. This month I have noticed a trend in movies that Lifetime is airing. They are all",1
42," The Whispers is a strong TV drama and thriller that I am really enjoying watching. I know I shouldn't be surprised that my favorite actor Mr. Ryan Phillippe is in it.

43," I enjoyed it. I thought the ending was a little predictable, and there were some parts that dragged a bit, but overall I gave it a 9 out of 10.

This is the second time that I've seen it, and it had a very different impact on me the second time around. I found myself much more sympathetic to Billy Warren, which I think helped",1
44," Great bit of acting by Al Pacino as a grouchy old man who is forced to confront his past to the point that he is forced to relive something he thought he was done with. Just when you think that all is well for him, his past creeps up on him. Kevin Dillon seemed to be able to portray a nice guy turned to serial killer. I'm",1
45," Well, this movie was ok. I actually really liked Alicia Silverstone, I think she's great. I liked how this movie was from the killer's point of view, it was interesting to see. Kevin Dillon I also thought he did pretty good. I liked how it showed the murders from the killer's point of view, and I liked seeing the flashbacks, very cool",1

47," This was a good movie. I enjoyed it. I liked the fact that it was a game on who did it. I didn't give the movie 5 stars because the first part of the movie was a bit slow for my likes. But it was good, I would watch it again. I would even go as far as to say it was a good date movie. RE",1
48," Oh my gosh, I just watched the DVD last night and I loved it. It's on Netflix so I didn't really know what to expect. But I must say that this movie is amazing. I cried because of the ending. I didn't want it to end. I want more!! But I'm so glad that it has a sequel because the ending leaves you",1
49," I've seen this movie many time, and it's not worth watching because of the plot, but because of the actors. It's the cast that made this movie so great. Kevin Dillon and Alicia Silverstone are so cute together, and Kevin gives a good performance as a bad guy. Alicia is also great in this movie. ",1
50," In a nutshell, this movie is about two brothers -- the older one is a vampire and the younger one is a werewolf. The older one is in a witness protection program and the younger one is taking care of him until he can testify in court. The older brother is played by David Boreanaz (Angel) and the younger one is played by Tyler Mane (Michael",1
51," This movie started out all right, but as it went on it became a little unbelievable. I know that it's based on a true story, but the ending just seemed so far fetched. The movie did have some interesting moments, but overall it wasn't believable. I did like the name of the killer though. It seemed so weird that the guy's last name was",1
52," I really enjoyed this movie. I loved Alicia Silverstone in Clueless. I had never seen her in anything else. It was really funny!!! I really liked the ending too. It's not something that happens in a lot of movies. It's a very suspenseful movie, and not a slow boring ending like some movies have. ",1
53," I saw this movie tonight on Lifetime Network by accident! I don't usually watch that channel but my husband was mad at me so he made me watch this movie and it wasn't that bad. This movie is about a woman, named Jill Marquette played by Alicia Silverstone who was caught by the FBI in the 1960s for her killing spree because she thought her husband was",1
54, I loved this movie. It was definitely my favorite one of the whole series. I don't know why but I love watching movies where they jump back and forth between past and present. And this movie was the best at it. Really kept me on my toes. It was also amazing how they managed to keep this movie a secret from the fans for so long. It was,1
55, I have seen this movie and even though I kind of knew who the killer was from the beginning I still liked watching it. I would recommend it to other people. It comes on Lifetime movie network quite a lot. And I am thinking since it's close to Halloween they might play it more. So please be on the look out for it if you are interested in watching it,1
56," I did not know what to expect when I picked up this movie. I saw it at the video store and saw that it had Alicia Silverstone in it, and decided to give it a shot. I can tell you that I was pleasantly surprised. The movie has a lot of twists and turns, and as always, the killer is not the person you would expect it to",1
57," i think this movie was a great movie to watch. it wasn't boring or anything. its more of a drama/thriller. it wasn't that hard to figure out who the killer was in the movie, even though it was a surprise to me that it was him by the end. im going to read the book now that the movie is over. its amazing",1
58, You should see this movie if you have time to watch it. MEANWELL: I love this show. I havent seen it all yet. But the parts I have seen are great. I love the two main characters. They seem to have great chemistry together. It is a cute show and I am excited to see more of it. ,1
59," It's not just the puns on the title of this one that are cheesy. There's also a pastiche of ""Singing in the Rain"" (e.g. when the musical numbers start up) and a big fight scene (dressed up as a ballet number) that takes its cues from the Flashdance movie. But this movie is actually pretty fun",1

I read her when she wrote what may have been called ""women's fiction,"" loosely based on her own life, and I've continued to read her now that she has turned to writing about murder and mayhem.

62," The story of the founding of Israel is one of the great love stories of the 20th century. It is a stirring tale of idealism, sacrifice, change and, well, love.

It is not a movie about the computer, but as stated by the director, a movie on human relationships. When the computer goes haywire, the knowledge and skills of the human beings are shown to be superior. Good premise and good acting. ",1
119," Now, that's a slice of old time action adventure. I hate it when filmmakers try to make period films by using a hot, smooth camera.

132, Total piece of crap. I knew something bad was coming because they kept introducing us to the characters and then killing them off.

This movie is filled with action, and a great story. It has a perfect amount of comedy for any kids to understand and love. I loved this movie and I hope you will too! <",1
198," A film for the eyes...and ears! The cinematography and camera work is magnificent! And the music composition is perfect for the theme and mood of the film.

I was impressed with the performances of both Maria Rohm and Carla Delanda. Both women give excellent performances and if you watch the film you will find yourself supporting them from",1
200," THE STRAIGHT STORY was directed and produced by David Lynch, and is based on a true story. It is a simple story, but in a way a powerful one. The film never seems to search for material or story to fill screen time, but it simply stays with the unfolding of the story. One can sense that every actor in the film is doing his or her",1
201," This is a simple, yet effective and entertaining story about a man doing what he must do to survive. The good elements of the movie are the setting (New Zealand) and the cinematography (the beautiful scenery)...even though the picture quality is a bit grainy. However, the director failed to take advantage of the natural surroundings of New Zealand. This is not a bad",1

203," Okay, on a Friday night, we watched this movie, and were pleasantly surprised. It was funny and had a good plot. We laughed out loud quite a few times and enjoyed ourselves. This is the kind of movie that makes you want to watch it again. It's not completely serious, and it's funny. It's good. ",1
204," This film has great acting, good directing, sound editing, and artistry. The script, though, has some problems. The Russian title is ""Pokhozhdeniye v Tumannyi Mir"" which means ""Journey to the Dark World"", and that's the way the film is structured, with the action in 1939, then a jump to",1
205," This is a much better film than I would ever have guessed, with a storyline that doesn't sprawl out too badly, despite being clearly structured for TV movie production.

It includes a Jewish concentration camp survivor, a convict, a young Irish girl, a policeman, and several other people, all of whom are connected by the recent death of a man. His death may have been a suicide or",1

209, It's not often the cast for a movie is so well chosen that the viewer feels he's in the presence of these people.

214," This is a very oddball film. I didn't know what to expect, but it turned out to be an interesting, twisted little movie. It takes a bit of backtracking to figure out what's going on (the film is told in flashback), but it's never dull and is actually pretty suspenseful. ",1
215," This movie's storyline, about a man who, during his life of crime, never once hurt anyone, is well done. Tough guy Harvey Keitel serves as a believable leading man, and the rest of the cast--including Chris Noth, Robert Pastorelli, and Karen Sillas--all contribute greatly to the film. The film's director, Jon Avnet",1

Jodie Foster, wonderfully played her role which reminded me a bit",1

221," This is the remake of a classic film. I never saw the original, but I really enjoyed this film. The characters were well developed, and the action was very intense.

223," This movie hits the sweet spot for my interest in contemporary film. The cast is amazing: Alan Rickman, Juliette Binoche, Johnny Depp, Helen Mirren, and even Michael Wincott. It's European, but not too much, and in English. It's romantic, but not too mushy, and it's humorous, but not too droll.",1

To get the full episode, one has to be willing to accept the slow, deliberate pace, and the long silences that separate the action. One should also accept the dialogue not",1
225," This was a very good movie. The message it shows is very important, that you should always try to forgive and forget. I feel that it is a very touching movie, and I could relate to it.

It's funny, and action packed. The plot is intelligent, and the acting is great. The movie takes a few liberties with the character",1
231," I enjoyed this film because it was a comedy with a major twist. Before I saw it, I was wondering how they would pull off the whole ""time-travel"" thing.

There are definite messages here, and a nice mixed-mart",1

I've avoided it for a while since it's been getting some negative reviews by those whom probably couldn't see the vision of the director. But now, I feel like I can give it a more balanced review. For starters, the whole idea of a near future setting is very intriguing. I don't",1

I saw this movie for the first time in my early 20's in 1964 on a New York City drive-in screen with about 20 cars in the lot, and a handful of people in each car. I went to see it again with a friend about 10 years later with a crowd gathered in a theatre",1

251," A wonderful film, although the ending left me a little depressed. I was impressed with how the director and cameramen managed to squeeze so many angles into each scene.

There are a few too many coincidences but it is well acted with a",1

It is wonderful to see how the characters grow and change as they travel together. A MUST SEE if you love horses, love dogs, are heartbroken, or just have love to give. ",1
268, I had seen bits and pieces of this movie several times. When the documentary came out I figured it was time to purchase the DVD. I found the documentary to be a real eye opener.

293," This is a bit of a timeless classic. It's about two girls who don't really know what they want from each other. They're best friends and practically sisters, but the better they get to know each other the more they realize they have nothing in common. I love the music. Also, I love the fact that the movie shows that everyone has the potential to be",1

Now that I'm older, I don't look for things in movies that I can point at and say ""That's",1

302," What a lovely little film. Even though i've heard the music being played on radio and have seen the videos a million times, the film was still a great experience.

305," Watched it, liked it... nothing more. Way too rushed, and not enough depth. I don't know why people praise it so much though... ",1
306, Hilarious! The humor is great and it gets better and better with each viewing. The film is quite clever and the main character is quite funny. The only thing is that it gets a bit repetitive in the end. I don't understand why people watch this and say it's boring. I don't know. It just isn't. Don't listen to these critics,1

It's nice to see that the series, by the 4th movie, was turning into a Hollywood cash-grab. The first Dune movie was the only one that stayed true",1

I find it hard to believe that first-time director Chris Columbus uncorked this masterpiece. I respect him so much more for it. He has done a great job of entertaining heaven and earth with this one. I was shocked to find that",1

It is one of my favorites. I first saw it at a friend's house, and have been laughing at it for years. I have it",1
329," As a fan of exploitation movies, I thought this collection was a bit of a disappointment.

The films are still great, but I think the explanations and alternate endings detract from them. Still,",1

32," Starred both Robert Mitchum and Jane Russell. Mitchum was at the height of his career. He was an up and coming star in the 40's in movies such as The Story of G.I. Joe, The Unknown Man, Fallen Angel, etc. He was the ultimate in cool. He was the guy every guy wanted to be and every girl wanted to be",0
33," My first negative review, I really, really disliked this film. The problem with it is that it's a western, and I don't like westerns. I don't like the way they're filmed, I don't like the way people speak, I don't like the horse riding, I don't like the ""cowboy"" look. I don't like the",0
34," In 1978, one of the hottest bands in rock history released their live rendition of their greatest hits, aptly named ""The Stones in the Park"". This record was the soundtrack to the documentary of the same name. The film itself is a goofy period piece that is more silly than impressive, but the disc is a sonic blast to the past with the legendary band at their peak.",0
35," I'm not sure why this movie has such a great rating, but it's not very good. I suppose it's not terrible--but not great either. It's got some good special effects--and the characters are all likeable. The story itself is pretty good. The problem is in the dialogue. It's pretty bad. And the acting--well, it's",0
36," A great movie with a underated cast, it follows a group of soldiers in the Vietnam war. It follows the struggle of a sergeant who is assigned to take his unit through the heart of the enemy territory to find his lost friends and bring them back alive. The movie is a dramatic war movie with some flaws. Some of the war scenes were a little too intense and could",0
37," ""Hiroshima, Mon Amour"" is often considered a movie masterpiece, but I am not impressed by it. It is basically a movie that doesn't tell a story at all, much like ""Last Year at Marienbad"". I found it confusing and difficult to watch.<br /><br />The basic premise of the movie is that Marlene, a",0
38," A poor man's ""Casablanca"" filled with cliches, stilted dialogue, and a one-dimensional feel. The plot concerning the hunt for a legendary Nazi gold train is a bit of a letdown. Although the script is boring and the relationship between the main characters does not evolve, I did want to see the end to see how it was all",0
39," As much as I enjoy Lee Marvin, I must admit that his participation in ""End of the Road"" didn't add much to the proceedings. I expect to see him as a tough guy, not as a soldier suffering delusions from battle fatigue. The film also suffers from having a first-time director. I am not sure whether this was the first feature of actor James Cob",0
40," I don't know why this is getting such rave reviews. It's a movie about a guy who wants to be retarded and how his sister makes a documentary about it, but he's getting attention from his doctor for his acting abilities. It's done completely wrong: not funny, not touching, not thought-provoking, not anything. What a waste of time. RE",0
41," This film was not very good, quite dull actually. The friend I went with said it was better than the first one but I can't see how it could be. The first one was at least funny and a bit camp, but this one was just boring. The acting wasn't that good either. The best bit was probably the bit where they had to walk in the",0
42," I read lots of the reviews and get where the criticisms are coming from. I will say that I enjoyed the film, but I can see why it was maybe not as good as it could have been and why it probably won't stand the test of time. The film pretty much takes place in the present day and the setting is a desert like prison where Sean Penn is a",0
43, If you see this film then you must have a lot of spare time and you must like really bad movies-FACT! ,0
44," I have to agree with Bob G., the A&E Biography ""Dennis Rodman: Bad As I Wanna Be"" was a total waste of time and effort. I am sure the producers of that film would disagree with me, and I am sure A&E thought they had a good deal, but the truth is the Dennis Rodman story is nothing more",0
45," Firstly I would like to say this film is a must-see. It is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. It is funny, moving and exciting. The two boys are fantastic actors and the way they portray their relationship with each other is great. The scenery is also breathtaking but the songs are a bit of a let down as they are not",0
46," Even though the movie is not that good, I still enjoyed it and it was a good laugh at the end. It's a very stupid plot, with some stupid acting with some great one-liners and a wobbly camera. It's very funny and just a good laugh. ",0
47," When me and my GF went to see this film, we didn't know what to expect, however she assured me that it had good reviews. So I went along with it. We got into the cinema and bought tickets and went into the screen. After a while of sitting there waiting for the film to start no one else walked through the door. I was very suspicious as",0
48," This is a film that is for the fans, not for the critics. It has a great story, great acting, great direction and editing, and great music. It will make you think about life, death, and the choices we make in our lives. If you are a fan of the Matrix or The Terminator then you should see this film. This is for those who",0
49," I'm going to have to say that this movie is very underrated. I mean, yeah, it's a horror ""remake"", but with it's dark atmosphere, it's just a really good horror film. And with great actors like David Duchovny, Billy Burke and especially Josh Stewart, this film is worth watching. The only negative things about the movie is",0
50," So was it a good movie? No absolutely not! In fact I couldn't pay to watch it again. You see, I love Daniel Radcliffe, I love his acting in Harry Potter. He is witty and funny, and has a great sense of humour. So I thought that this would be a great movie. I was so wrong. The acting was terrible, in",0
51," I was very intrigued by the premise of this movie and the cast, but when I actually saw the film in theatres I was very disappointed. While the acting was good, the story was horrible. I can't believe the woman got away with it, especially as they didn't really explain WHY she got away with it. It was so bad, we didn't finish watching",0
52," A very good documentary on the making of this film. While it doesn't go into great detail, it does show just how much work went into making the film look realistic. It also shows what kind of dedication the cast and crew had to the film. I really recommend it if you are a fan of the movie and want to know more about how it was made. RE",0

54," What a waste of money, time and effort. I had heard this film was an interesting story about someone with multiple personalities. I was expecting more than what we got. We were not even told what the story was about. Apparently, a girl who had been abused was going to tell the story of her life, but there was never any mention of this. Nor did the",0
55," I bought this movie purely because it has the late, great David Bowie in it. I must say, however, that this is probably the worst movie I've seen in a long time. The acting is poor, and the plot is complete and utter CRAP. Do NOT waste your money on this piece of garbage. I remember thinking that the music in the film was actually",0
56," This movie is great! I saw it tonight with my friend, and we liked it a lot. I remember seeing this movie when I was younger, and I didn't understand it a lot. I didn't understand why people would go through all of that trouble to go to the moon, just for a publicity stunt. But now, I totally understand what they were doing.",0
57," I got this DVD to watch with a friend and we both turned it off after about 10 minutes of watching this crap. It is a very cliche story with nothing new or interesting in it. I don't like to comment on the acting in a film like this, as the characters are so stupid that you can't take any of it seriously, so why bother. The",0
58," -I love the book and I was expecting to love the movie. I thought the casting was good except the kids. There were a couple of scenes that I thought were good. The movie was moved around a little bit and parts were changed. I think if they had left it alone and just played it straight, it would've been better. I remember some parts being better",0
59," Perhaps the most ridiculous movie I have ever seen. I watched it with my GF in a cinema and was in stitches by the end of it. I would reccomend this to anyone. Just expect the ridiculousness of the film and you'll be fine. It's a film to watch when you're in the mood for a laugh, not to take seriously. RE",0
60," So I watched this film with my girlfriend, we had seen the first film and went along with the second one. So we went to the cinema and waited to get in. When we got into the cinema and sat down it was just us two in the whole theatre. Now I am aware that the film was meant to be missing people because of a virus that was spreading,",0
61," I went to see this movie, having been a fan of The Hills Have Eyes and The Hills Have Eyes II, I thought I could get a good scare within the first 10 minutes or so of the film, but I was wrong.

63," This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. I do not recommend you waste your time on this film. It has a very good cast with great acting however the story is so over done and the plot doesn't make sense. It is set in a future where machines have taken over and people are enslaved to them, but we never see these machines",0
64, It's not really about the plot of the film but more about the original book by Lewis Carroll... so my take on it is that the effects were amazing but the film itself was not that good. I have read the book and have read the story so I know what the story is about. The way they have put it into a movie I think they have just made it,0
65," I was invited to a premiere screening of this film in London so I obviously said yes. It was a very different experience to going to the cinema and actually paying money to watch it.

However, when I got round to actually getting round to watching it, I found out that it was nothing like the originality that the trailer made it out to be. The plot was quite frankly ridiculous and it was almost a parody of",0
68," Well, when I first watched this film, I was quite disappointed, the film didn't have any of the original cast and it wasn't the same story. However, this time I was very impressed. It was a decent movie, however, if you're going to watch it, watch the original not this one as this one is only for the fans of the original.",0
69, Can I just start by saying that I absolutely loved the books and was so excited to see the movie adaptation. So let's begin this review... ,0
70," So when I was a kid I was fascinated with these stories of these people who would go inside these houses haunted by spirits and would get the house to leave them alone. There was one story in particular that I was fascinated with and that was the story of ""The Haunting In Connecticut"". So when a film came out based on that story I had to see it. The",0
71," I can't really say much about the plot except that it is the story of the young boy who is adopted by a pair of scientists who raise him to be the most dangerous of animals a human, who has no concept of right or wrong and who is then sent out to hunt the man who murdered his father. ",0
72," This film was a bit of a surprise. Usually with horror films you get your usual characters, but with this one you don't, well not so much all the time, yet there are some who stand out. The victims are well played and the actors play well together to create an atmosphere that gives you the creeps. This film is a mystery with no one really knowing who",0
73, This is a film that I watched whilst I was studying for my A levels. It is a story about a guy called Kevin who is a bit of a nutter who is eventually sent to live with his grandmother who he had never met. His grandmother wasn't very healthy and when he was there she died as well. In the final scene of the film he is seeing his,0
74," It is a rule with me to never be impressed with a Tom Cruise film. They are usually predictable, boring and far too ""Hollywood"". So when I went and watched this film I was no different, I went to see a movie and it was not a brilliant movie, but it was entertaining. The story is about a group of guys who rob a casino and make",0
75," Apparently this film is based on the book ""The Eye Of The Beholder"" by David Balducci. However they have changed the name from that to ""The Eye"" as it is a remake of the 1960's classic starring the late great Faye Dunaway. I have heard many mixed reviews about this film, which worries me being as I am a big thriller fan",0
76," I sat down to watch this film and I was very excited to see it, but when the film started I was a little disappointed. The start of the film was a long build up and it did not start properly until the last few minutes of the first scene. When it did start properly it was very action packed and you could see that it could have been a great film",0
77, I gave this film a go even though I wasn't sure what to expect. I decided to watch it anyway since it got average reviews. This movie is about an American guy and his girlfriend who meet on a train. She gets off before he does and he gets caught up in a mess of different situations all surrounding a woman who is half naked. One of the situations involves,0
78," Could have been a decent film, but the story is so predictable and the film drags on. There is no point to the film whatsoever. It is just the same plot repeated over and over again over and over again. There is no satisfaction to the film. You see a lot of famous people in small roles, but you won't recognise them. The film would have",0
79," Hilary Swank once again playing the inspirational young woman that is abused and emotionally torn apart but still manages to hold on to her dreams. I liked the movie. I was very happy with how it turned out. However, I thought that the movie became a little too preachy about telling people about this horrible crime in Asia. They didn't need to tell you so much",0

81," I really like this movie. It's got the Indiana Jones vibe to it. I had never seen it before, and the plot was a little unbelievable, but its a great movie. The animation is great and the story is a lot of fun. The characters are a little shallow, but its not really a movie made for such character depth. I think it's a fun",0
82," Well, I thought it was going to be ""The Sitter"" meets ""Stuck on You"" but it was SO MUCH BETTER. It didn't have the silly moments or the constant potty humour, and it had a nice little message to go along with the storyline. I really enjoy the movies that are made by Adam Sandler and his production team. They",0
83, This movie was really awesome. I thought the special effects were great and it had a very good story line. It's a story of a person who is basically a slave to his master and does everything he is told to do. Will Smith does a great job in this movie. I would recommend this movie to any sci-fi fan. ,0
84, This movie was an incredible surprise. Very scary. ,0
85, I liked this movie. It was fun and exciting. There were some good action scenes.,0
86," A fun movie, but nothing too special. I always enjoy a good horror flick, and this one delivers. The best thing about it is the plot. A small town that is suffering from an outbreak of strange, zombie-like people. The smaller town folk are turning into strange zombie people, but they don't have any control over what they do. They follow the people",0

89," I rented this movie after watching the first Pirates movie, figuring it would probably be just as good. It wasn't. Very disappointing. There were no great action scenes, and the plot was lame. I was caught off guard in the beginning to see Johnny Depp play straight as an arrow. I was used to seeing him in a movie like this, with his character being",0
90," The title credits do not come on until the movie is over, that is a tradition beginning with the original ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" in 1951. The movie is no less of a classic, with a plot twist that will leave you breathless. Another classic is the music score, by Bernard Hermann. One fault of this film, or maybe it is",0

I'm not",0
92," This movie is a great concept, but it was just executed very poorly. The idea is that there are these people who were experimented on as children by the government and now they all have the ability to be anyone they want. This is good for anyone who is an actor or just wants to change up their look, but it's bad if someone is doing it and they don",0
93, I live for psychological thrillers and this one is a must. I was shocked to find out this movie was based on a book. I cannot wait to read it. ,0
94," The movie is well acted, and the story is interesting. The big problem is the inability to focus on what is important. The police seem to have no clue about what is happening, the medical staff has no clue, they can't even ID some of their patients except by their blood type. The ""villain"" is obvious almost from the start. So there are more",0
95," I've seen better, but given that this is the first of two part movies, it's not too bad. The movie is a bit jumpy, and I was still confused as to why Chase's mom was working on the program, even though she works for the government, and why she would even bother with that. I'm hoping that part will be explained in the",0

97," I usually can appreciate the intense violence in movies, but here it is just too much for me. I guess they also try to put a supernatural side to it, but I thought it was just ridiculous. I thought it was going to be a slasher movie. But I guess my attention span was short enough, so I didn't give it a chance. People were disappearing",0
98," Terrible. Horrible. Worst movie of the year. Waste of my life and of my money. I would return my eyes to the stores if I could. Worst movie, worst actors, worst director, worst movie ever!!! You can't even call it a movie. Nothing happens, nothing changes. Nobody teaches anything. It is the same thing over and over. It",0

108," This movie is terrible. I rented it without knowing anything about it and I am so disappointed. The previews made it look like it was going to be a lot of fun, but it doesn't even come close. This is a sad excuse for a comedy. I'm glad I didn't waste my money on this. It isn't even worth renting. ",0
109," I was not too sure about this movie, but was interested in seeing it. I was impressed by the first half. It was a great movie until the last half hour.

111," The Perfect Storm was a great film, and the reason for this is that they didn't try to overdo it.
