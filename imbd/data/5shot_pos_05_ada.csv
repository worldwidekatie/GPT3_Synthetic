 This is the kind of film I could watch for an hour and not care about anything else. This is the kind of film I could watch for two hours and not care about anything else. ,1
" I'm not completely sure why I love film, except maybe it's because it provides a framework for all of life's great adventures. This movie, however, fails the test of time. ",1
" I'm not one to give much of a shit about whether or not it's entertaining, but I did enjoy watching this movie. Was I surprised by the inclusion of the casting? Yes, as I expected. I liked a lot of the characters in the movie. The acting was especially good and, if I hadn't been watching it with a TV screen right next to my",1
" If there was one answer to the question: what should a movie be, this one is it. I remember seeing it the first time, recently, and can honestly say it is one of the greatest movies of the last decade - period. The story of a man attempting to solve a giant jigsaw puzzle is told from the point of view of Walter (Michael Douglas) who",1
" This is a classic movie of the sixties with the same style as the oscar-winning Joan of Arc(1823-1862), but it's even better and offers a little more insight into the human psyche. The Country People(1962) is the film that truly brought RCA to its peak, it was the first color film of the era and pretty",1
" Rosemary Wilson, for the first time ever in a feature-length film, was given a chance to shine, and she did so poorly. It's a shame that she doesn't get as much work now. This premise for a movie was a stroke of genius. Ironically, this is the first film to be set in England, and it dwells on the actual events",1
" I was in the middle of watching this (which, for the first time in my life, was an Italian-French movie) and my girlfriend turned to me and said, ""What do you think of ""L'Avventura?"" I thought to myself, ""is there anyway I can get on eBay and buy this movie?"" I was so confused because I didn't",1
" I'd heard a lot about this movie, but never saw it in person. I give it 4 out of 5 stars. ",1
" Everything that has happened in the world so far, the peoples' ignorance, their unthinking thought process, their tragic lack of guts, their lethargy, their impotency, their animal tendencies, their constant need to ingrain patterns of thought in their minds and bodies... all these things are presented in this movie. But somehow, the people, the people in the",1
" I'm not usually the conspiracy nut like your audience, but when I saw this movie last weekend, I just could not stop watching it. Somehow, a few years back, I was a skeptic about the movie based on a review that I read in a magazine, and I wholeheartedly agree with it now.<br /><br />I'm not sure how it got",1
" As in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, things get off to a great start with the opening sequence in which two New Yorkers, a Jewish but hurtful person and a Palestinian, are being chased by a man who takes a hammer and a knife and threatens to kill them. The man tells the two standers, the man and the woman to leave him alone... all they want",1
" Let's be honest here, here's what I liked: ""The Fox"" is a very refreshing take on the tone of 80's wannabe horror movies. It stars its biggest star of the day, Donald Pleasence, and their regular cast, the most annoying of all, Dean Norris. It does this by introducing us to a couple of new characters (Hal",1
" My mantra here is to keep these lists simple. I think it's safe to say that this would be a must-see. All I can say is that it's a little silly when you think about it... But it's not dumb, really. It's just silly. ",1
" Well I'm a bit amazed of how the movie seems to have out done itself with this special edition DVD version. Every time I think I have seen it, I haven't, and am in fact more than a bit saddened by that. It's a shame because the BD (home video) may not be as good as the real thing, and I'm not sure my",1
 Ew! It reminded me of Malcom X! And I loved it. Vincent Price is amazing. ,1
" I certainly didn't lose any sleep over that one. A (definitely not realistic) story of a man who kills his wife and then has a bizarre affair with her best friend, who turns out to be a top-secret spy. I don't think any of these names are in the movie, but I felt compelled to mention them because I'm a fan of John",1
" If you can't handle the sheer ridiculousness of the film ""La Reine, la Reine,"" you could stand to take a Breathalyzer test. It's absolutely awesome! DO NOT MISS THIS FILM! ",1
" As opposed to the drama of Young Lions of the American West or Gentlemen of the Road, this doc is really about the town of Conchos, where a number of the campers have to be rescued from the Mexican soldiers. I was skeptical of the movie when I first read the description, but it was not until I watched the film that I started to see what",1
" I find myself returning to this movie from time to time because of the humor and the story. It makes for a good time until a runny nose and a dirty shirt. You can't help but laugh the whole time you're watching the film. As for the music and the voice-over, it's just perfect. I've listened to a song somewhere sometime and it",1
" I've long been a fan of the 'Red Skelton' series, and I can tell you for the first time that this is exactly the kind of film I would recommend. The bizarre and hilarious one-man show of a film director who plays a television personality who inherits a bunch of show-biz traumas is a classic; it just gives the director",1
" I was never a huge fan of this kind of movie, but a few years ago I saw it and had to once again go out of my comfort zone. But I think it's an interesting story that's worth watching... The story is recited from the point of view of four explorers who find a strange cave in Peru which contains a dead baby. They set off with",1
" This movie is a compilation of David Boreanaz, John Diesms, and Michael Cera as part of the ""50 Greatest Movie Makers of All Time"" list. Considering the makers of this movie were the brains behind the first two John Hughes movies (Life of Brian, Beat Bugs, etc.), I found most of it to be excellent. It even seems like",1
" Tammy has a nice sofa tucked in the corner of her bedroom, waiting for the arrival of her boyfriend, Ted, who is apparently away on business.<br /><br />Where to start? Well, start with the premise: a woman is awoken from a nightmare by the voice of her deceased husband. In the dream, he is talking about his children, his wife,",1
" With the exception of the film's title, this scene and this action scene are the only things I really want to talk about in this review... for the most part. The other two scenes are highlights of the movie. ",1
" I remember seeing this movie when it first came out in the States back in 1967, and I thought: This is the kind of movie that I'd actually like to see in my lifetime. I still think that way today on the DVD release, although I really can't imagine rewatching it in its entirety. It's a tale of two young adults from two dysfunctional families who",1
" Was this a bad movie? I don't remember seeing it, but then again I haven't seen in a little while<br /><br />Boy meets girl and then girl dies and boy decides to find out why. I liked this movie, and I think it goes that way too... ",1
" What's not to like about this film? One of my favorite characters of all time, a rugged, smooth-spoken, young man subjected to a series of eight brutal dates (the most brutal of all the dates is the final date) by a forbidding, pompous dark lord, is also the one who became the personification of the word ""repressive""? So",1
 I started watching this movie knowing nothing about it and now I have seen it a couple of times and still think it's a real gem. Why the hell is this movie so hard to find? It's only in the theater. ,1
" This film is a lot of fun, and incredibly well done. It's the kind of movie where you want to see the movie at least once in your life. It's also a movie for people who don't know a lot about cinema. This is a movie for people who know a lot about cinema and want to see it again. I recommend it to everyone.",1
" Episode 1 had a very interesting premise: a small, sexy woman called Daisy (Mae Whitman), on a commercial ship, is kidnapped and held captive inside an island resort. Everything is fine until Daisy's most ardent admirer, Jerry_top (Billy Burke), is allowed to visit the island for the first time. Like the rest of the cast on his visit, he",1
 I have seen this movie and even though I kind of knew who the killer was from the beginning I still liked watching it. I would recommend it to other people. It comes on Lifetime movie network quite a lot. And I am thinking since it's close to Halloween they might play it more. So please be on the look out for it if you are interested in watching it,1
" This movie is not just good at being butch and hairy, but also pretty much kinky. It has the look of a masterpiece and the sex is always great - satisfying and still hot! ",1

It comes on Lifetime movie network quite a lot. And I am thinking since it's close to Halloween they might play it more. So please be on the look out for it if you are interested in watching it,1
" This is a well-conceived and well-written piece of American tragedy, and I'm all for seeing it. I think it does justice to the subject matter, and to the actors who play the leads - both of whom are excellent. It may not be the greatest film ever made, but it's definitely on my list of the best. ",1
" If I had to choose one movie from the past seven years to comment on this year, it would be this one. This was a great, fun movie, just like the one I went to see at the library. I don't think I would've enjoyed it much if I hadn't been there to see it, but that's what I wanted to see. The whole",1
" This was my first time watching this movie. I saw it quite a few times as part of my summer idea watching theme, and I think it has a very good message about human nature. The ultimate idea behind the movie is a very different one, and the message is a very different one, but both are very well-done. The film starts with a murder and then",1
" I haven't seen the movie in a long time. So this is the first time I've seen it. For a while my nephew and niece are watching it with me... They must have already seen it at least a dozen times... This movie is so good it brings tears in my eyes either because of the emotion of the story, or the music and sounds. I think",1
" I was aware that The Lord of the Rings was the fargothe movie of Tolkien, but I didn't realize that it was all about it. This movie is amazing! The acting is spectacular, the directing is superb, and the movie is very well written. The only thing that's missing is the sense of wonder that keeps coming for me almost every time I watch this",1
" In a world in which cinema is becoming more and more commercialized, this film's lack of substance surprised me. It's not a perfect movie, but then DEFINITELY not a perfect film. ",1
" I must make this clear: I haven't seen this film in years. I have only recently started to revisit it (I am a rather casual moviegoer, more concerned with finding the right movie to see than giving the right rating). I am so glad I did! This film is a masterpiece of movies. I went into the film with a huge expectation of it being",1
" I must say that I find this film to be one of the most original of the 70's, and that is very difficult to do. The story in this film is much more about teen angst than usual, but the characters are actually quite likeable. I imagine that Billy Crystal and Lisa Kudrow will be particularly interesting. I find it difficult to see how this could",1
 Blake Brody's beautiful and well-taken-out portrait of the famous songwriter has attracted great interest here in the past. ,1
" I particularly liked the song ""You Can't Make This Half-Way House"" performed by Kevin Spacey's character David, the Music Man.<br /><br />Of course, the rest of the movie has it all very much else to offer, including a very likable lead character played by Matt Damon. A few of the supporting cast members are also quite good,",1
" Because it is a gay-male movie, I am hesitant to compare it to another movie that is often regarded as a gay-male movie. But in this case it is Deep Throat, something about which I am only too happy to say my appreciation. I see the movie often and sometimes it is even better than I remember. ",1
" It's easy to be cynical when it comes to Christopher Plummer's and Meryl Streep's control of the cult shtick in Titanic, but I'd be damned if it wasn't the best portrayal of a true survivor of the Titanic disaster so far on the big screen. If there was one major drawback to this film, it's that the cast didn't share that",1
" Excellent - possibly the best recently released film in my time. The script is beautifully written by Richard Price and it moves fast, with wonderful effects. However, there are some interesting digressions into the lives of Charley Chase, the man at the center of the story, and Rex Connor. It's certainly worth watching, especially for the first time. Michael Haneke",1
" My experience with this one has been, and I mean it, only tangentially. My first memory of this movie is that I saw it when it was on in 1954, the year of the original release of the film. Since then, I have seen it numerous times on the VHS and Laserlink release platforms, and I have enjoyed it every time. What I will",1
" Well, what can I say about this one? It's not exactly the best of the bunch, and I think it's really the weakest in the series. Well, yes, but for a different reason. A little bit like Chopper, this is a movie that's too densely shot, too long, too much about sex and far too little about political issues. The",1
" I didn't see this one coming, at all. I think I had just come off the Internet with a truly unwatchable movie of a different time, and had overlooked Hollywood's fascination with historical vampires and werewolves. The film's main attraction, and it is one of the best I've seen, is the story of twenty-first century AIDS. The director (",1
" This was not a good film, but it was a well-made one. ",1
" As a film that sticks to the same emotional and philosophical themes, and has few of its own moments, this film is only marginally less tedious than its predecessor. It is also more serious in tone. I've always liked the films of Laurie Anderson and most of the films of Jonathan Demme, and I would be happy to see that they continue to make films. REVIEW",1
" Your interest in the K-M-C must be fairly intense, my friend. I would really have to say that this is the best classic film I've seen in a long, long time! And what a debut! It's so big, so novel, so marvelously studied and also so very pleasing to the eyes, it's a pleasure to watch. It works",1
" I think I may have reviewed this movie before because I've seen it a dozen times already, so here I am again. It's a very well-written story, and Brown probably had the best dialogue. ",1
" This film could probably have been made without Mr. Jackson, but it was wise to have him in the production. This was the first time that Mr. Jackson had made the leap from the stage to the screen, and the experience was worth it. As a spectator, I liked his performance a lot and was impressed by the quiet dignity with which he approached the dramatic task.",1
" I have seen this movie twice now. There is so much to like in it: fantastic performances by both actors. Likewise, the movie's entire running time is over 32 minutes, so it is a splendidly entertaining two hours. The story has a certain ring to it about it, too. I've always liked John Updike's writing style, and this movie is",1
" Seems like the 1980s are going to be a hot topic in the United States. I have always loved the movie 'Batman' and thought it was awesome, until I watched this one. 'Batman' is more than a little sci fi, which made it seem like a farce. This movie seems to go for the big picture a lot more, but I am still",1
" Well, it's just a good summer film, but I'd really recommend it to those interested in the subject. I believe the movie is just as original as the musical I mentioned before and highlights all the great things about the play. The movie tries to show all of the characters from the play, but many of them aren't given a chance to shine. ",1
" I haven't had the opportunity to see the film yet, but I will say that I thought it was a pretty good film. It's a little dreary and has a few minor plot points that I think should be brought down with the film's length, but at least it's a decent movie, so we'll stick with it anyway. I'm looking forward to",1
" This is the first movie that I've seen that I can't say anything other than ""what a beautiful movie it is."" A special mention needs to go to the cast, who did a fine job here. In general, the balance is very well maintained with a lot of good parts, even some uncomfortable ones, thus providing an interesting dynamic. ",1
" This was my third visit to the Orlando Film Festival, the first being in 2008. In the past, I've seen Birds of Prey, a film I'd seen several times before, but never very memorable. In 2001, I liked it so much I watched the film again and again, and on my last visit I saw it again. As a result, I didn",1
" I'm not going to try to call this one much of a Hollywood movie. It's a great example of overblown melodrama and a total mess. It's really about a woman and a man hiding from the world and each other, but in themselves. It's hard to say how much they even really know about each other. It's really difficult to care much",1
 I never thought much about the movie before I saw it and I was so caught in the moment of watching it for the first time that I was so moved by the film that I knew it was the next best thing. But when I heard the players talking about how they needed each other to succeed and how just like a big brother and a little sister they were going to face,1
" I've been following a lot of TV adaptations of what I always liked. I know that they're usually pretty awful and not very good. But this is the kind of movie I want to see with my besties, my wife and mother, and my kids. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie or TV show that I felt was funnier and smarter",1
" I'm not sure if this is my first or second time seeing this movie, but I'm pretty sure that it's the first time I've gotten to see Sergio Leone's movie. However, as a Leo-destroyer, I have a lot to say about this film. After all, I've had a chance to see the other two films in the series as well",1
" Written by Michael Jackson and directed by Michael Jackson, this movie can be read as a story of redemption and survival. It's not exactly a movie that you would need to know much about. Things happen in come October and December 1972 in Los Angeles, not Philadelphia or New York City. With an appearance by everyone from Michael Jackson to Michael Jackson's future wife Kathy Richards, a",1
" From a modern sensibility, it's sometimes hard to watch older films. It's annoying to have to watch the stereotypical wallflower librarian have to take off her glasses and become pretty and stupid to win a man. Especially such a shallow and inconstant man. He's obviously a player (I wouldn't trust him to stay true to her) who doesn't want to",1
" I've seen this movie so many times of many different genres and styles of storytelling, it doesn't seem to get better than this. It's basically a retelling of the movie Thriller starring Peter Cushing, with a lot of more physical violence on the part of the characters, returning to the original film's themes of freedom and respect. As a result, this movie",1
" Mel Gibson was very funny in The Passion of the Christ . . . and I think he could do a good job in this movie. This one was very by the book. Based on a play by Shakespeare, this is a very long film, but if it was shorter I don't think it would have been as good as the play. It's nearly two hours long,",1
" Alright, so you guys are reading this now, but why the hell are you reading it? It's bad enough that that's all you read, but if you're going to be reading it, you should be reading it in a timely manner. This is a film that needs to be seen whole-heartedly. The acting is superb, the direction fantastic, and the cinem",1
" Once again, Donna Reed's best performance in a long time. She's still as glamorous as ever and even wittier, and her character playing the brutish, brutal, and emotional, um, director-in-residence, Craig Brewer, she's really great. She plays Donna so well. At times, it's almost like she's a character in her",1
" This is such a great movie, that I know I will not be seeing it again in its theatrical release, but I would highly recommend it to anyone who would like to see some great (not to mention sexy) women. I think it has to be seen to be believed. And that's one of the things I love about this movie: It's really good to watch",1
" This film was released in 1967, but seems to have been released in 1964. I believe this is the third picture (after Airport of Dreams and The Barraks) that Marlon Brando also starred in. All three are classics and it is a wonderfully clever, original, and funny film. This one especially has me thinking about 'The Apartment' and the wonderful",1
" A producer hired by a Christian bookstore to produce a full-length film on the scene of the Holocaust, his first objective was to create a macabre looking erotic movie. But he quickly realized that with its content he could not challenge the hateful taboo in the world of cinema. And so he made this creepy, strange film instead, one that was devilishly entertaining and far more",1
" I don't know of any better film than this. I am therefore a little unsure about the story just a little. I don't know how I feel about the early scenes where the girl gets her hands on a boy, but I'm not concerned about the bar fight. Thanks to Eva Marie Saint and John Gilbert, we have a don't-be-hurt one",1
" I have seen this movie twice, and decided that it was a real sleeper hit when I first watched it in the theater in '55. When I first saw it, I was disappointed to discover that the film was actually about a cousin of mine, and so the film's plot basically consisted of my brother and me swimming in the same pond for a few minutes. If I",1
" I saw this film when it was first released and have been a fan ever since. Everyone seems to think it's the best of the bunch, but I think it's a really good little story that truly deserves its own place in the pantheon of classic films. It's an essential movie for some people. Its story is a little more riveting than any other of its",1
 This is one of the more underrated and underrated film types out there. This gave me a lot of time to think about and debate about this movie. It's called 'It's Just a Movie.' And it's got a featurette. ,1
" If you're a fan of The Magnificent Seven and watch it as often as you possibly can, this is a must see. The movie once again is the most visually rich of the series, with a cast of stars that includes Jamie Lee Curtis, James Purefoy, Ian McKellan, Melissa M̈chborn, Kristin Scott Thomas and Matthew McCon",1
" When I was in the last decade of my life, I was hooked on films like Johnny Guitar, The Harder They Come, The Grand Budapest Hotel, and I was hooked on films like Easy Rider, so I didn't even know that there was a film like this in the world or that it was even made until I saw it for the first time in 48 years.",1
" This movie has been announced as a Debutante project. It was a little sad to see it made into a movie. This tastes like what I call a ""brick and mortar"" movie. It's a little disappointing to see it in the theaters, as the production features a couple of picture familiar actors, though very few films have been so transparently generic. It",1
" I watched this movie a few weeks ago. I liked it. I thought it was a very good movie. It was a little bit heavy in the beginning but after awhile it got lighter. I liked the romantic stuff but the other stuff, I didn't think was very good. I think he acted a little bit too much for the part. I think he was trying to",1
 This is a great movie and would be a crowd-pleaser if it was not for its short running time and lack of a running time. A few reviews I read in the Star-Bulletin I liked the movie so much they were able to share it on their website with the whole world to see. But as an actor I don't think this movie would work,1
" A masterpiece, it's not for everyone, but if you are an admirer of the Bard you will find this a delight. I always loved this play and have tried to reenact the moment I saw it in the theater. I've watched the film many times and can't pick one thing to recall because my memory gets all bent out of shape with such poignant thoughts",1
" THE TOP 3: 1. The Magnificent Seven (1954) The Magnificent Seven ""is not just a movie, it is a film, a film created by two young people"" (The Hollywood Reporter) ""I'm the kid in the class, I'm the kid in the class. The kid who has to fight for his right to get into the movies.""",1
" I've seen about 7 movies about Mr. Wonderful. And I was skeptical about this one. Too many times, Old Hollywood had to be trimmed to keep it from being too on-the-nose. But it turns out that if you watch this one you won't even realize the difference until your stomach is in knots and your brain is spinning. The film was shot",1
" Three years ago, we commissioned ""Lone Star"" written by Christa Wolf with the help of ""Mahone"" by William Faulkner, the screenplay titled 'The World Is Too Small.' It was a very nice project, was far more brilliant because of the use of every minute of the film to the narrative. A few months later, Bruce Beresford and",1
" The film's subject matter would have been a foreign country, except for its cultural resonance. San Francisco, California at the time of the filming was a beacon of freedom and good times, and to film such a film would be foolish. The filmmakers were aware of the American blacklist, the atmosphere of the post-war wave of immigration, and the increasing dominance of Hollywood. The",1
" I recently saw this movie in the movie theater and really enjoyed it. Just two things that convinced me that this was not the movie. One, that it was filmed in Columbus, Ohio. Two, that the player in the hallway to the right of the entrance was wearing a costume. ",1
" When I came to the film to check the title out, I was deeply disappointed. I felt like this would be a fair response to rather elaborate in debate on the evils of Nazism and the horrors for which it was responsible. I could not hope for a better response than to just enjoy it. I was right. This movie really is a masterpiece of human drama. In",1
" I saw this movie years ago. I don't remember what I thought about it. I had no idea what to think about it, and I find that I am still trying to figure out what I thought about it. But, now, making a new review, I am convinced that I was wrong about this movie, and that I, too, must now be acknowledging its",1
" I have come to this movie in a few years before its release, and have left it often again since. . . . it's easy to ignore its merits, but it just seems to get better and better. . . . I don't know if the director was at his best, but the crews brought the movie to life. . . . I loved it, and",1
" I have always loved this movie. I saw it when it was still fresh in my mind, as it should be. The director, Alvin Sargent is a fine photographer who does a marvelous job. This movie is very realistic and is about true people, not just computer simulations. The movie is about the life of a young man. I thought it was a very well",1
" I do not know who this movie is based on, nor do I know very much about the plot. It was a sensational, and it was a success, but I am not sure what it is about. It is not a great movie, and not a great one at that. The style is comical enough to make even a normal person laugh, and the plot is",1
" This movie is a masterpiece. The perfect tribute to the best times of the 1930's and 1940's, when we watch bits and pieces of classic movies on TV, and realize that they are from the best films that ever existed. And with its haunting imagery, but with a unique twist, it is the perfect way to get to know the best films of the 1930s and",1
" I know this is a hard title to pronounce, but this is the best movie I've seen all year. I would have to agree. I haven't been able to watch the whole movie in one sitting. The story of Tarzan, Jack the Ripper, and an auction house is just amazing. The torture scene, for sure. And the ending - the final scene",1
" As film watchers went, I was a little surprised to see that this, the 50th Anniversary Edition of the classic ""Das Boot,"" offers a lot of information about the history of the distinctive little boat built in 1898 by the Dutch army near the town of Bad Wildbad near Bremen, where Oberbannsal, the tribal group whose chief is the dec",1
" One of the best comedies ever made. That's not saying much, considering that it's actually in my top ten. I've seen it dozens of times since I first saw it on TV. It's a rare film that requires no introduction to anyone. From the “true story” of the last robbery of the Frank Erskine's gang, to",1
" It's good, I liked it. I thought my tension levels went up, but I didn't feel any great passion with the movie. I have been a huge fan of the movie since before I could read or watch movies. ",1
 This would make a great holiday movie. It's a dramatic story with a good view to the fact that William F. Buckley Jr. was just maybe the worst President in American history and his subsequent administration and those that came after. ,1
" What a great movie! I've seen this movie many times and I love it. It's difficult to look at and does not say so much because it's so pretty. I don't mind the color, I like the color of the color purple. I like the music. I like the sound of the slot (""God Bless America""). I like the way the movie is",1
" This is one of those films that you can't really discuss without laughing and/or crying. It's funny, it's sad, it's a beautiful film for an elegant and beautiful young woman to read a script from and write a movie with a tragic and sad history. This story is a beauty and could have been in the top 10 of the greatest movies of all time",1
" I also liked this film. I was hoping for a good storyline to make it more interesting to watch, but I was not disappointed. I loved the hard-hitting messages in this film about the negative effects of so many ""people"" watching a movie. I think this is a good film to show to young people about the importance of watching movies in a logical and healthy way",1
 You can't really tell much of the story without the actors. It is like seeing the movie but see the actors in their characters. And I loved the movie. I liked that there were no more talking people in the movie at all. It felt like a real movie. I think there should have been more interaction between the actors in the movie and there is very little interaction,1
" This is a movie that should not be seen by anyone under the age of 18. The movie was made for teens who are interested in horror especially in the kind of movies people like to watch. The plot involves a young girl who is to be her parents' new housekeeper and has to be the perfect person for the job. But, she ends up in a slums",1
" I saw this film with a friend and although it was a bit of a letdown from a ""well made"" point of view, I liked it. The idea of having a modern disaster movie in theaters caused me to seek out this movie. I don't think I would have liked ""The Great Escape"" or ""The Wicker Man"" if it was not for all",1
" There was a lot of angst, angst, angst in this movie, and I think I would have liked it even if I had seen it sleeved up and on DVD. I just took a break from watching this movie at the beginning and went on to watch the sequel. And I think that the movie was worth the wait. I like it, but it was a little",1
" The producers of ""Pacific Rim"" were trying to dig up the memory of the great and talented John Travolta. The result is a movie that, although at it's very best, is more like a low budget kung fu flick than a movie about aliens and robots. It's a silly movie, and it's a far cry from what it should be and",1
" The original telling of The Merchant of Venice has some good ideas and some not so good ones. The good ideas come from Rafe Spall, who plays Shylock, and the fact that he shows he really likes his job. Really liked the movie. It's hard to think of any movie that has brought such an emotional reaction from everyone to a film. The composer",1
 The movie was fairly good. The concept of the movie was good. I liked the script and Charles Dance did a good job. It isn't as good as the original but it is still an interesting movie with a good concept and good acting. I really like the way Carlos Vegetto does the film. He might be a Hollywood actor but I think that he does an incredible,1
 It was incredible. I thought that it would be a good movie to watch if you are a fan of Bogus John. The film had so many scenes I could not stop watching. And I have never seen such a good movie as well. You should see it. It was crazy. You could feel their heartbreak. You could feel the tension between them and the tension,1
" Its a shame she didn't get screen credit . She by far did the best job in the film has the girl on the cross , best part of the movie .She had much more impact than Avril , or just about anyone else in the film .

" I found this film to be very good, the dialogue was all there, the story very funny and the characters were well developed. Although it was a little bit slow at times, I liked it. 3 STARS.

",1
" I have to tell you, I was really surprised. I was expecting the movie to be very gripping and could not really relate to the story. I think that this movie is about loving and not forgetting. And the relationship with your best friend does help you in so many ways. I tried many times to watch the movie and I just could not because it seemed like too much",1
" This is one of those movies where you might not know what to say or what to think. You kind of have to watch it to find out what you are in for. But once you do watch it, you will be hooked. I liked the movie more then the first one. The second one was kind of very dull and not very good. I liked the first one",1
" In our society the movie ""Nowhere Man"" is a great movie and a movie that anyone can enjoy. I know some people will say that the movie is too boring but I think it's terrific. I dont think the movie is off the wall fantastic but I believe that the movie is not a bad movie. I believe that Alice Eve has a great future in the movie",1
" For those of you who have read this blog or ask me what the hell I am talking about, I don't have to tell you that I am glad to finally see the film. I think that it was a waste of time and money to produce a film that really only did the job of being a movie. It was just a cheap, tacky, ""you can",1
" This is a chilling depiction of life during the Depression with terrible food prices, horrible unemployment, and racism. I liked this movie because it was filmed in the mid-90's, it had a tinge of perception-altering knowledge about the times. This was my first experience with a film about the Depression and the movie gave me some insight to what the Depression was like",1
 I was thinking about getting this film and it's really good. The cast is excellent and the story is well written. I would definitely recommend it to people. The storyline and characters are well done and well written. It is a good movie and I don't think it's going to be ever made into a big-budget film. ,1
" It's a very charming movie. For example, when the doctor catches the killer, and the doctor seems to be working for a big corporation, I know that they are working for a government agency. The film is satirical, but that doesn't mean it's bad satire. It's a very good film. So many films are even better. I don't agree with the",1
" The film was very well cast. The acting was good, and the storyline was very interesting. The problems with this film, however, are that first off the main character is not likable, and you have to try and figure out what kind of person he is. Then, the story is too predictable. The film is nothing more than three different stories, one about how",1
" It is a pity that they try to get into the movie without the presence of an actor (or actresses). It is a shame the director never got around to making a film version of Shylock the Nasty Jew, because he made it seem so easy to follow the plot and make matters worse. I've gone through lots of film books and books on television, but",1
" I know you have seen this movie before, but the stupid thing is that it comes from the point of view of a nazi. The movie is a re-working of the 1947 movie starring Walter Matthau, who happens to be one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen in my life. The movie is about a nazi, who is trying to live straight",1
" The movie was made in 1999, which means it is really 20 years old by now. But it's still a very good film, and it's one of those sci-fi movies where the future looks like the future and the character is the character. I personally think that there should be more stars in sci-fi movies because a niche doesn't make the audience's heart",1
" Aside from that, it was a great film. I liked it for some of the parts in the movie, i.e. the the son-in-law, Cate and Kerry, and the father who has a really nice case of the craziness. However, I didn't like it for much of the other parts; the boyfriend? Who knows. REVIEW",1
" I watched this movie a while back, and I'm not sure it was the best movie I watched.I do think that this movie had better cinematography than so many of Shakespeare's plays. I don't mind Shakespeare, but he can often seem melodramatic, especially in this film, and particularly in The Merchant of Venice, the play about a Jew in 16",1
" If you are prepared to spend a WEEKS of your life watching the Marlene Dietrich movie ""Homage to Mr. Lincoln,"" this is the film for you.<br /><br />Yes, that's right. The movie is called ""Homage to Mr. Lincoln."" Isn't that a little too nice, don't you think? That's because this",1
" Most of us will remember the Monty Python movies from the first, when they were a highlight of our childhood. Most of us will also remember the last film, when it was a must-see. This one is probably a bit more accessible than the earlier films, since it's marketed like a film not much older than 2001: A Space Odyssey. But the new movie",1
" A contribution from the current state of women's rights, and what these words mean to those who are threatened by their female colleagues. This statement comes from a statement intended by the Executive of the Shriners' Hospital in the 1940s, which states (among other things): ""Every woman in every hospital, every college, and every hospital in this country must be free from",1
" I think this movie has great potential, if Ms. Sagal returns to the role of Miss Me. She is one of the most beautiful and talented actresses in Hollywood today. I know that she has have a movie on the way that will be mastered to a T. It is a great film, and I hope that it will be made into a major motion picture one day",1
" Panacea was one of the greatest films of the '80s. It was a strange mix of horror, comedy and romance. It was one of the first films to use the computer in a major way, by allowing the actor to change the setting from a Middle Eastern desert to a barren, barren landscape. It was a classic example of the ""you can use a computer",1
" As a child I had a box set of Pirates of the Caribbean, and I have seen it over and over again since then. I was very disappointed that the made-for-TV movie sequel and the TV series were not as good as the first movie. The first movie was seriously entertaining, even if it was a little confusing and was a little repetitive and forgettable.",1
" It's a difficult film to make. Michael Radford's new film is a tough to-watch production. But at the same time, it's a worthwhile one. Does it have a heart? Sure, the heartstrings, as they say, are always great, but they get in the way of the story. And by the time the curtain comes down, the star",1
" Though not the best movie I've seen, The Sailing of the Bellini is much better than ""Cinderella"". It's more The Sailing of the Bellini than Cinderella. It's the first movie I've seen where the female leads aren't the brat. The female leads are beautiful and the dialogue is entertaining. ",1
 I think your statement about the character of Shylock is true. The character of Shylock was an anti-Semite. But that doesn't prove that Shakespeare wrote him. Hamlet was written to be a friendly opposite to Shylock. ,1
" This was a good movie. There were several things that I was pleased with. I liked the film's script and the way it drew the audience in. I was hoping that the first half of the movie would be a bit more dramatic than the second half, but the second part was well worth the extra time. The movie is geared to a younger audience. The dialogue is",1
" The fact that this is a classic movie is not a secret, but it does not detract from the fact that it is a good movie. California Dreaming, released this year in theaters, is the first major modern film to capitalize on the success of a book that is also a bit of a classic: John Cheever's ""The California Dreaming."" The film is nicely",1
" I found myself completely fooled by the premise of this film, and I did NOT cry. This is a film full of women who fall in love in the first half of the film, are together the entire movie, and then have the misfortune of being captured and abused by a man in the second half. The premise of the film is that the beautiful, loveable and ideal",1
 Women don't need much incentive to speak up if they get the chance. The moment of the individual's eye contact with the woman of the hour or the mere fact that a woman is wearing a suit makes it a no-brainer. But those all-too-human characteristics - or lack thereof - are what make some of these women crazy. Your average woman will be the,1
" The fact that the play was written over 60 years ago might give you the impression that it was written for an audience of comedians, but it is far more than that. For one thing, it's a magnificent piece of theater. From casting Gary Cooper through directing Michael Caine, Bill Condon knows how to create wonderful, absorbing performances out of virtually any kind of material.",1
 Allegra Mendes was one of the best actresses of the '90s and I was always saddened by the fact that she died. She was an actress that I was in awe of and her movies always made me feel sad. It's not just the fact that she was a good actress. It's the fact that she was a woman that was performing at such a high,1
" It's funny! I recall that I was standing near a canal in the city during the good old days of old days, I had a very interesting view of the sun, a small boat called a braggart was looking for a patient, and he was sailing towards the city. And I was leaning on the railing watching the sun, and in that moment, I heard",1
" I was very surprised that there were more than two female characters in this movie. It was hard to tell if they were women or not. In the first scene where they are playing piano, they are both exactly the same gender, but the male character has to change his name so that the audience will think it's a woman. The one thing I really disliked about this film",1
" I never have seen such a great movie. The characters are well developed, the acting is great, and the story is entertaining and suspenseful. There was a scene in the movie that does not follow the plot of the story, but it's still engaging. I liked the ending and thought the ending was brilliant. I think the movie could have been much better, but I",1
" Good show, but very disappointing. It's a superb film, especially when I saw it ten years ago. Quite skilled acting from the beginning to the end. It's a very moving story about a very rich and successful family, and the enjoyment they had is truly amazing. It's a pity there aren't any more sequels. (Not that there will be) REVIEW",1
" It's not to say that it didn't work, but it did not work. After watching the film, I felt like the movie was a bad idea. I did not understand why they brought in a film with such a shallow plot unless it was to infuse humor, but they did not add anything. I found it frustrating to watch a movie in which the plot was",1
" I liked the movie the most it has a very good story and there is a great deal of wit in it. I like the fact that it is a revenge movie. I feel the way the main characters lived their lives was interesting. I liked the character of Rory, as I found him to be a simple, practical guy. It would have been a lost cause for a",1
" I gave it a rating of 5-oh-movies out of 5! It's one of the best movies I've ever seen!

I thought the costumes and the actors' performances were superb and the ending was emotional and beautiful.<br",1

" Not that I was watching the movie, but I saw the movie on VH1 and I had to see it because it's a classic. I liked the last scene, where they're going to the beaches, and they're dancing. I mean, how can you not like that kind of dance. It's just so hot and fun. <br /><br />",1
" YES! I thought the character of Amy was too OTT, but I was tempted to watch the whole thing! Definitely worth watching this film. The music and scenes are 20/20, and the actors did a great job.

As a film lover, there are some films I like more than others. This was not one of them. The movie was well executed.Personally, I",1
" Although it's the first horror movie I had seen, I really loved it. When I saw it, I was a teenager in my teens, I wanted to see a horror movie asap. I didn't really know what to expect, I was having a bad day and I was in a bad mood, of course, when the horror movie came on. This movie was",1
" This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. The story is simply amazing and interesting. When the movie is over, I was very happily excited to see more of the film, but I just want to finish the movie and know that I have gone 1,000 years to see this movie. <br><br />I love the way that the movie is set",1
" Well, there is a good-looking bartender who just keeps ignoring the barbiturates that get drunk and tough guys cheating on their wives. He's based on a real life guy who moved to LA a few years back to get away from his mom, but he was kind of a douchebag. He was a really nice guy, but he was a douche",1
" I like this film. I adored Laurel and Hardy, I adored the movie's storyline, but sometimes it's hard to see why they should be on the screen. John Peebles, Tom Hanks, and Robert Duvall as a trio of very self-conscious men trying to keep the women of the film happy and not realize its just a device to",1
" They did an amazing job with the whole story. I thought the actors were great in their movie. It was the only one I was able to see. The script and character development was great to see. The funny parts were excellent, especially the part where they went to a yacht club. The performance of the Keanu Reeves was really good too. Especially in the chase scene",1
" Another example of what a brainless film can be. The movie stars John Ritter (minus the guy he was playing, but with a slightly different voice) as a former working class man who's in love with a beautiful woman. The film is filled with good lines and genuine feelings but also uses humor to keep it entertaining. The movie is also an excellent example of the",1

" I was really surprised at how well it was performed in the theater. The performances were superb, the young talents were excellent, and the idea was cool. The story is a bit short, but some of them are good. It was good to see an actor who has not had a hit movie before in the movies. It is really nice to watch the young talent, and",1
" A show that is nostalgic, with an nostalgia from the 1960s, ""The Next One Goes to Hell"" is an interesting psychological film, whose main characters are the protagonists of the story.

Never forget this, whether you love it or hate it..<br /><br />Well, my Dad drove Lee Evans back and forth the hotels so",1
" This is a beautiful movie. It has the best of the best Turkish actors in the world. Amir Khan as the 'father' and Kenan Malik as the 'son' were great. The story was stripped of much thought and emotion, in a good way, and it is a masterpiece of Turkish cinema. It has the best of the Turkish cinema. It is one of",1
" You watch this movie and you don't cry, and you don't want to. I love this movie. I watch it at night so I don't sleep all the time. When I see it, I see something so extraordinary, that I can't stop thinking about it. I saw it in the theater, and it was a great movie. Mike Myers is the most",1
" This movie is not in the least bit related to the film that follows it. The only exciting part of the film is the appearance of a man who is your friend. It has a very good beginning and never lets up. This is a nice, short film which is more than enough to satisfy audience, especially with the addition of a few extra scenes to put the movie in",1
" The director, Terry Zwigoff is the type of director who really knows how to bring a film to life, and this movie is no exception. Phil Karlson is a great lead role, and his role is not only a good one. But also the scenes between Karlson and Audrey Tautou are absolutely superb. This is a movie that is very different from anything",1
 The picture is very good. The editing is very good. I think the director did a good job. The writing is excellent. I liked it. I guess it will be a summer film. ,1

 I must say that this movie is wonderful! It is the best movie on acting I have ever seen and I have seen a lot of good movies. I have seen some of the best movies in the world. The content of the movie is very good! The only problem is the directing. The director is not expert in directing. He does not have experience directing the actors.,1
" Wish I had seen one of these when I was a kid. If only I did not have to work so hard after college for so long to get a degree that I could not pass on to my children, I'd be a lot better off. I wish that I had seen this when my dad drove me to the movies, or even picked it up at the library.",1
" I liked the film for several reasons, first of all, it was a fantastic story. The actors did a great job, and there is no way that I can say in five words that I disliked this movie. It is like a roller coaster ride through life when you watch it, but like I say, I'll never forget that ride. I just think that movies like",1

" I've had my eye on this movie for a very long time. I've been waiting for Michael Douglas. I'm not going to judge him for being absent when he's on screen, it's just that the movie has a decent cast of actors. A totally different feel from The Da Vinci Code. I suppose a movie where Steve Carrell takes the overused role",1
 2:20 is a film of great entertainment. And 4:20 is better. Both the title and opening credits appear to be from the same movie.

The film speaks to all of the same themes of,1

" I'm going to do an extended review of how I feel about this film on day one! I'm not a big fan of director Paul Thomas Anderson. He's a very talented filmmaker, but I have a mild aversion to his movies. He took an idea that I loved and made a bizarre film with a very strange setting. I didn't think I was going to like",1
" You know how people say it ""a good story is better than great story""? Well, that's one of the most important aspects of the film. The great part of this film is that it's a good story. Its not a great story but it's a good story. The film will always remain remembered for that, not for the great story. ",1
" It would appear that there is a problem with the quality of the restoration of this film. The film has some artifacts. Some of the less desirable artifacts include a redscale print of the bottom right hand corner, which is flat and exposed, and a print of a printed scene in which an A/V lens is visible behind the camera, even though the print is diagon",1
" I am not a fan of this film, as its too closely in line with the 90s era of Westerns. It is very well directed, if a bit slow, with very few over-the-top moments. At its best it appears to be a very good combination of the gritty, frightening elements of westerns and the morals of the period. ",1

" ""I've got two daughters , and I don't want kids if I get out of the house"" is a comment that was heard at a very young age.

 I saw this film with my parents in 1997 and it was a great time at the theater. My dad had not seen this movie until 2002 or so when it was re-released on DVD.

There's family fun and then some challenging experiences where the mom leaves the baby alone (this is my favorite of the season) and then the dad comes back and the kids are in 3 days. We also get to see some drama, and some of the relationships take a turn for the worst.",1
" This is a very watchable film, although I must say that I find it strange that the majority of the video is produced by the Russian Union, who produce several movies in the Soviet Union. Perhaps they were jealous of the Hollywood effort, or perhaps they were simply unable to make good on a promise made by Peter Jackson in The Lord of the Rings. Roanoke and",1
" Carrie was a great film. I thought that the original was a little too short. Before the Spanish Civil War, Franco had just been installed as ruler of Spain. This was a time when Franco's regime was advanced. His regime was to some degree an authoritarian political rule, but the leaders were all free men, and he was the first to say ""we are a democracy",1

" This was one of the greatest actors who ever lived, and one of the most underrated. The only reason I would give this a mere 3.5 stars is because I have to give the benefit of the doubt to director Stephen Frears because of his overused movie style, which I have heard many bad things about, but the movie itself is amazing. Like the entire cast",1
" OK, so a good movie is like a good road trip. I was constantly amazed and mesmerized as I followed the plot of every scene of the movie, for I was a fan of the show when I quit school in the mid eighties. I didn't see that show as often as I should, because I really liked the other shows on TV, but I still",1
 This movie is a little dated in genres. This is no 1980's movie where the action thriller is the main focus. This was a movie about a couple's attempt to put their lives back together. The film was inspired by a book by Eden Elia called 'What Lies Beneath'<br /><br />The film deals with the tragic death of a man named,1
" This show was so nice to watch. The show should have been better. The show was very good but they should have been more than one show.<br /><br />I did love this show because of the actors who played the roles. And I liked the use of color and the use of music, and the use of the camera. ",1
" I absolutely loved this show, it was a great film. The stars did a great job and the writing was excellent. It was a must see for sure. Although everyone was very busy, the show was funny and lively and the acting was awesome. As the young and soon to be adults, the show made me wish I was still a kid, without any adult responsibility.",1
" It is a rather slight but nice piece of work. You can definitely tell the directors were inspired and thought the subject matter through a wide lens. Once again, you can't help but like this film.

It is a beautiful film, well written, and it's gorgeous",1

 I love it when movies are made in this country. The fact that these pictures are made in this city is amazing. This was a film made in four hours. I absolutely loved it.

" I thought this film was superb. It is science fiction with a healthy dose of humor. The ending is not what you would have expected. But I'm not sure what it is. It is a surprise ending, but not a heart breaking ending. It is sad that we are living in a time that is so out of balance and out of touch with what is actually going",1

What a wonderful hour, of history and travel, of the last 40 years. It is definitely one of the most memorable",1
" This is an amazing film. I enjoyed it but I thought the story was pretty flat. Was there any really interesting characters? What about the storytelling? I never liked the antagonist's character and the film didn't really push the main character's character. Finally it made me appreciate the really good artists. Even though the film was brutally realistic, I still enjoyed it. REFER",1

The only person to see him is a woman with a camera, played by the fantastic Jane Fonda. A surgical surgeon, who can't risk losing his patient, is forced",1
" This is a funny, wistful story of an ordinary family as their love continues to rise and fall. A beautiful, sad, moving, moving story about family and a family's journey through grief. There are scenes of the family's romance and joy. A young man has fallen in love with another man and their children. The wife and the husband are separated by men",1
" At first glance, it could just be a very ordinary film about a cult actor and the people he inspired, but visually it is as unreal as you might imagine. There's a scene where a middle-aged woman walks down a long corridor, the bare light of the corridor cutting through the dark and the shadow of a man who looks as if he's tripping over something",1
 This is one of those films i have to see at least twice. I first saw it in 1966 when it came out on video and i remember thinking it was brilliant. The story was great. It was about the construction of a house from timber and the whole thing of what you were allowed to lay with in the house. But the idea behind the film was that the houses,1
" Dustin Hoffman's brilliant portrayal of the cliquish, often alcoholic, young Boston Irish mobster Joe Gores is unapologetically over-the-top. Hoffman is almost too much in his own right, and I find myself rooting for him to find happiness and find his own way. His motives are not transparent in the film, and the focus seems to be on the",1
" I think that the film is a little dated for the time, and the film seems a little too long to make of my most recent experience being a teenager in the late 80s. With the release of the film, the media and the public thought that the film was going to be too long to leave a lasting impression on the viewer, and that made my own enjoyment of",1
 It is a true story about a young woman (Joanne Woodward) looking to make a start in the music business in the mid-sixties. The woman's parents are rich and she is in a class above the rest. This film is an interesting insight on teenagers who were on the verge of the professional world. The father is played by David Moore who was already well,1
" It should be a classic. Director Daniel LaGravenese and writer/screenwriter Paul Schrader have created an enjoyable mix of comedy and tragedy, five styles of which collide on the story of a young man overcome by his fate.<br /><br />Perhaps the heart of the film is the sense of humor that come along with the guilty pleasures of a young man's",1
" This makes a great 'after the movie' film. A young, but capable, actress, has become entangled in a web of deception and death.

So begins a journey of ironic bent through a",1

 Some films are for me too depressing and/or heavy for a film student as a whole. Some are just really obvious and have no redeeming features. This is not one of those films.

" I have seen this film on multiple occasions and I have never seen it in person. I first saw it in a group setting. All four heroes and their friends demonstrate tremendous courage. Each hero was born to kill and they did so in a way that we could relate to. The protagonists are breathtakingly courageous. In the film the three main characters, Kneeshmoy",1
" I am a huge fan of the Disney and Marvel classics that I have seen, but I have never seen any of their newer offerings, but I will guess that there is the possibility that Shrek will be a follow up to either The Aristocats or Pocahontas. I have not seen either of them, or any of the Universal movies, but I have loved",1
" This is a story that is so well written and told, that it takes influence from the other films that it was based on. The character, or characters, are the ones that are most memorable. The storyline is fascinating. The characters are interesting, but sometimes they seem from who the writer is. This movie is a must for a film fan. ",1
" This is such a mind blowing, fascinating film. I can't believe this movie is even on the subject of animation. As a child, I love animation, but I was never really sure what it was. In the early days, I thought it was just a sketchy form of theater, but that has been about half a century ago. It was more like a fancy",1
" I heard of this movie by a friend from a film festival that July. I saw it a couple of weeks before it opened at the Athens International Film Festival. I was afraid. It was supposed to be a bit of a miss for me. I thought if I saw it, I would be disappointed. But after a while I realized that this is BEAUTIFUL!",1
" I unequivocally recommend this to anyone who reads my blog! I've been a fan of the TV show for years. Every year it gets better and better. Why? Because the show is rooted in real life and just like many others, I've seen the show from different points of view. I've also seen it from new angles and perspectives, such as when people talk about",1
" It's a pity there's no documentary on the making of the movie, as it would surely enlighten many on how the whole three-hour thing came to be, and even how the whole thing was hatched in the first place. I've seen the one documentary on the making of the movie, and it was really fascinating. The other thing is that they did a three",1
" This is one of those films that is being displayed in a shopping mall. I also love it. It is well worth seeing. When a movie has a real strong cast, that's something that you can always depend on. This film is a good reminder that this has to be done and done right. You can't always see it from the outside. ",1
" Robin Williams surprised me with his talent and the strength and longevity of his voice. He is the voice of me so I am looking forward to his performances. Everyone is playing a part, from the lovely, sweet Mrs. Warren Keel to the ignorant misanthrope Mr. Quillan. The cast (especially Robin Williams) does a wonderful job by giving us depth",1
" I just recently watched this movie. The movie is beautiful. It is full of interesting characters and world-building. There is so much happening in the movie. It has a very good plot and a good cast. I really liked it. It is such a special, haunting film. I would recommend it to a friend. ",1
" From what I've read so far, what I find to be the most interesting is the cast of the film. All the actors are fantastic. No matter what skill level, there are a good many talented actors in this film. I think that the most outstanding thing about this film is the story, and that it is a dark, troubling tale. There is a real richness",1
" I can't believe that I've watched this movie for the first time in about 4 years. The last time I saw it, I am still to this day in shock how good of a film it is. It's the perfect film for PAX showings. What a film! It has more heart than most films I've seen in the past and many have commented on Kubrick",1
" This is the kind of movie you want to see, because it is so good; and, when it comes, you want to see it. This is a new, refreshing, gripping, deep, deeply moving movie. It's got a wonderful, unforgettable cast. If you're into Alice Cooper, your kid might be into these guys. It's a great movie. RE",1
" I was originally thinking of the [The Avengers](Somewhere Inside the Ocean) concept with the theme of a world-weary but nostalgic World War II officer character, but the film is better with a more substantial and actual WW2 action theme and is a better story than the one of a hero's childhood come-back with only a few action scenes. REVIEW",1
" I'm going to start from the beginning, since I saw this film when I was 13 years old, and it seems like I've seen it every year since. It was the first film I ever saw where this good-looking young man, who was a giant in school, did something that was close to being a crime. I enjoyed this film so much, and I",1
" If you've never seen ""Do the Right Thing"" you've missed out on one of the most hilarious comedies it seems.... I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, thinking I'd give it a chance, and then, oh my gosh, I saw it and it's awesome!! Yes, funny. Yes, funny! Yes, funny!! Yes, hilarious",1
" From the moment that I saw the trailer for this film back in 1998, I knew I had to see it. I walked into the theater and sat in the back of the theater, out of the way of all the other people in the theater. I was at a loss for words when I finally made it up to the second row and saw what was glinting in",1
" The former Governor of Pennsylvania, Michael Dukakis is really the only political figure of our country to get how it's done. He's been sentenced to three and a half years on a tour of duty to the place on which he lives. As a bonus, he's been awarded a Congressional Gold Medal as an historical figure.<br /><br />The film does get",1
" Director: Philip Baker Thompson, from the “The Exorcist” trilogy ",1
" I couldn't put this movie down. The script, the acting, the direction, the cinematography, the sets, the costumes... everything was magnificent. The choice of Ralph Bakshi's 'Ridiculous Adventures In Science Fiction' as the film's opening and the titanic weight of it means that this picture is big. And it's a movie that I have",1
" It's funny to see how familiar Dad seemed to many of the audience members who watched The Lord of the Rings with me.I loved the part of the policeman who thought he was in on the kidnapping.I liked the part of Mr. Rafferty who threw some lazy-ass, overweight joke at Mr. Rafferty. Also, the part of Mr. R",1
" I never read the novel ""The Secret Agent"", but i decided to enjoy it because i liked the movie. I decided to watch it after watching the film without reading about the book. My reaction to the film is the same as I did to the novel. I liked the movie more than the novel. The dialogue is good and the characters are well rounded. The plot is",1
" One of the things I know is the importance of silence - so I can't say I'm pleased when I hear commentators say, ""Oh, those little kids don't talk, the adults talk."" First of all, the little kids will not say anything to each other when you are in the same room as them. If you asked a six-year-old kid if",1
" In the early days of his career, Ronald Colcan was often compared to Walt Disney. But he wasn't all Walt, or all Disney. The reason that so many people sympathized with Walt Disney is because his movies were so over-the-top and played with his many conflicts. I don't think Colcan would ever think of that. But when he started working",1
" A DOUBLE LIFE is a fairly standard character/provider of the kind of movie business I'm interested in. It's not bad, but it's not great either, perhaps a bit too much of the same. But it's entertaining as long as the story is told in a way that makes sense. For example, a lot of people seem to think that Michael",1
" If you are into a lot of different things, why not watch a movie about a lot of different things?<br /> If you are into guns, how about a movie about guns?<br /> If you are into martial arts, how about a movie about martial arts?<br />If you are into politicians, how about a movie about politicians?<br />",1
 This is a must see movie for every film buff. I'm not even sure this movie could be made without the films of Ken Burns of the National Geographic channel. I would have to say that the film is the best documentary that any filmmaker has made. It's not a walk-in movie but an honest movie. The film makes it clear that the characters are real but,1
" In his very first film, David Cronenberg (The Fly, Mel) does not disappoint. And in this, his first featured role, he is one of the most articulate actors I have ever seen. He is so good at playing a scary character and gives it his all. Also, the director of the film, Bruce Slade, is so good at directing and shooting",1
" I couldn't be happier with Anthony John Colman's portrayal as the title character in the movie ""The Royal Tenenbaums."" It is a memorable movie and you'll see that Colman has one of those ""pull-cause-it-was-you, pull-cause-it-isn't"" stories. Reviewer:<br /><br />",1
" It may be just a gimmick, but director Peter Jackson must have thought it would be something interesting. The thing is, it's not. It's too campy looking and bog-standard in idea and execution. That said, it's entertaining enough that you don't mind the film's ""invention"" and its limitations. The world in which this film is set -",1
" An interesting concept of an animated short film is that of swapping back-and-forth between two episodes of the ""Smart Guy"" series. Through the assistance of a visual element, elements of both the Smart Guy and the Smart Guy (or Handsome Guy, if you prefer) episodes are interwoven. This is the sort of thing that would be more effective if the",1
" By some miracle this news story mysteriously got picked up by a local news station, who used the story to broadcast the news, as did the BBC. Since then, there has been no further news about this little man's death. Apparently, he died of a heart attack. I feel for his family members, but it's hard to imagine he had anything special. It was",1
" When Vail and I were trying to decide what to do to our first travel-trip of the year, it was pretty clear to us that it would be a lot of fun. For a while we entertained the thought of going to Princeton, but it seemed like such a big commitment to make. So, we headed to Buffalo, New York - one of the biggest cities",1
" One of the most entertaining and moving films I've ever seen. It's often hard to find elegant, dramatic films that gel with the modern world of the screen. There are many appeals to the humorous part of the culture, and the soundtrack of Celine Dion, Marvin Gaye, the Smiths, the Beatles and so on, but there's less emphasis on the sacred",1
" This is an odd film. The story is about a man who has to leave behind family and friends to live a life of crime. Yet, even though the film doesn't quite fall into the normal darkness of a crime film, the film isn't quite unwrinkled either. What makes this film especially interesting are the lovely performances by the lead actors. John Carrad",1
" I love this movie, but I really wish that I could have seen it at least once in my life. Not that it's bad - it's very good. The story is so good that it's almost too good. I'm not a fan of Shakespeare, but I was very much interested in this film. In a way, that's likely because I was also interested",1
" One of the best ever, and totally underrated as a live action film. Go see this one, or more than one if you like it!<br /><br />I have seen the movie twice since the first time I saw it after having seen The Phantom Menace. I can't say enough good things about it. It is, in my opinion, the finest",1
" And then we come to the end of its storyline. This movie is a revenge movie for Colman's father in that Colman was in the movie, but the family thought this movie was in the wrong place at the wrong time. If you're not seeing it, I think you're going to have a bad time seeing it. ",1
 I was surprised and pleased by the reception of this movie. I like the idea of the film being very much a work of art. 'The world is a changing place' is quite a theme. Director Craig Brewer has allowed for this to happen by having the characters playing off each other and smelling at a pretty flower garden. A shot of the flower and a shot of the,1
" Halfway through this film I was expecting a bland and unfocused film with the obligatory love story and movie star. Instead, I was taken on a rollercoaster ride. The first half of the film is a languorous mess, all about setting up the story. I don't want to call it ""mythology,"" because pretty much any kind of mythology I can think",1
" Compared with other kind of picturizations of a man's life, MUCKERLAND definitely is a non-fiction film. It could be played in a playground or a theater anywhere in the world - which may be better for the movie's message. MUCKERLAND is as much a body of work as a picture. It stars, it tells, it features,",1
" Please help Blackberry avoid being the title of everyone's favorite animated shortcut. This movie needs to be one of the best animated movies ever made. the animation is amazingly well done, the story is more amazing than anything else on the planet, the music is truly awesome, the colors are amazing, the fact that we have the ability to watch a full length movie without hunger,",1
" Stuart meets, WOTC meets, Raging Bull meets, Bulldog Drummond meets, Raffles meets, Raffles meets. Tony Curtis' third feature film is no doubt a mid-life crisis, but even so it's a good one, a good enough story line and is surprisingly sharp in comedy. This evening's film is a good, sharp 'spring break",1
" When you look at the world today from the perspective of a child raised on a dollar, you're probably kinda used to it. When you look at a dollar you're only going to know one thing - TIME! Time is the big thing.<br /><br />The world of any child raised on a dollar is going to be very different than the world you grew up",1
" David Lynch's film begins with an exact copy of the opening of Citizen Kane. In the film's story, an ensemble film, the characters have a third identity - that of a young man and a woman. Their lives change from the start, as they find themselves gloriously bound together in a beautiful film, but two-dimensional, pushed to the brink of collapse, their",1
" A DOUBLE LIFE was a great time-killer, generally thinking about how a movie can be told through the perspective of beauty or the monotony of an unlimited number of characters, it's an easy read to understand and enjoy. ",1
" Though I am not a fan of 'modern' animation generally, I love the animation style found in this film, particularly its retro style that is totally absurd and yet at the same time somehow tactile at the same time. Some of the elements in this film are very distinctive. The use of the square element in the shape of a body alter ",1
" One of the many reasons to not watch this latest Madonna movie is the fact that it has an ""epic"" opening shot that only serves to heighten the already incredible, eye-level allure of the movie.<br /><br />The magic of the film is right there in 2011: all the compelling young women, dressed in the most vibrant and chic of f",1
" This script is very much a Morris-Brinkley-Benson movie. It starts out with a man's life being ruined when he receives a letter from a woman who claims that she is the reincarnation of his lost love. This simply couldn't be more wrong. The guy is a serial killer who has 12 victims in his possession, and she's a magical being",1
" The directing is superb and the performances from Hugh Grant, Sean Astin and Kenneth Branagh are excellent. One of their greatest qualities is their ability to have the audience relate to how each is feeling as they see and hear everything. I especially liked the way Brendan Fraser himself plays three people in one single shot - it reminds me of how the audience is one image in one shot",1
" I'm not a huge fan of the art direction of this film. The script, that of Craig Brewer, is heavily influenced by the work of Barry Levinson. It's a shame, because this film has some very wonderful moments. I think those who are not familiar with the writer of the movie will enjoy this film. It's a busy film with plenty of scenes to",1
" The remake of The Exorcist is better, if less confusing, thanks to the many cheaper, more accessible elements produced by the original, and much more sensitive to the sensitive, but not to the weak, creative spirit of the original filmmakers. ",1
" One image which pops up repeatedly in the theaters in this film is the over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top over-the-top over-the-top over-the-top over-the-top over-the-top over-the-top over-the-top over-the-top over-the-",1
