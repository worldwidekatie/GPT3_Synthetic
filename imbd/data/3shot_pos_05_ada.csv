" As a child of the eighties, I am a huge fan of 'Annie Hall' and 'Superman'; this is certainly not as good as the two earlier films, but is still entertaining nonetheless. ",1
" This is one of those films I thought about when I was a college student. Ridiculously staged and incredibly over the top on the truest level, this film is one of those films that should be required viewing for anyone who likes musicals. It's not particularly good, but it's extremely popular. ",1
" As I love old movies, I love old movies all the more. I LOVE this one. I mean, I LOVE it so much that I would pay my rent to watch it again, even though I'm already out of episodes of The Rockford Files. I just want to say that this movie is like a black hole in many ways, except much, much deeper.",1
" This movie was amazing. I filled in as much background information as I could to get a feel for it's history and mood. From that point on, it was a solid movie. ",1
" a book published just a year after my own book, I'd be a little uncomfortable with a film that's not exactly a college student's POV, but where the authors have recently written about a particularly important moment in their own lives. Again, I see it as a wonderful piece of biographical information, and the film does a splendid job of condensing it into one tightly",1
" The inclusion of Colombo's Bombay Beach is about the only thing that made this a cohesive, rivetingly beautiful and uplifting film. From the very beginning, to the final shot of the film, the characters are real people. They need each other. They need each other. ",1
" I'll only offer one word of sympathy for this film, and that's a total lack of it. It's a decent film, but what I don't like is the offensive portrayal of the Australian bush, as is immediately apparent with the opening scene, although we can't help but feel the author insults our sensibilities here, to the point of ridicule. ",1
" I had the pleasure of attending the recent screening of the ""New York Drama Festival"" sponsored by the New York Film Critics Circle, which presented the ""American Birds"" by the author of this book, John Miller: A Visual History of Modern America.<br /><br />As most people will not be aware of, I have always been a huge fan of Miller's aforementioned",1
" There have been a few movies that I've enjoyed, and most of them are indubitably classics. But I really dig the buddy-cop movie, especially the appearance of Charles Bronson and Bob Newhart. I guess a little bit of both is necessary in order to shoot a movie as clever and cleverly executed as this.<br /><br />One thing that",1
" If you happen to be in the mood to watch this film, you don't want to miss the bit when Jackson and Corso finally part ways. The reunion scene is one of the film's most bizarre, and inky, moments. As Corso is being helped to his feet, he pulls a gun on Jackson and tells him, ""You ain't nothing to me",1
" Introduced to this film, I found myself thinking, ""Wow. What a film. It's too bad I haven't seen it. It's bound to blow my mind."" But I didn't have to wait long to see what it was. As soon as I turned the lights off, I was in the theater cheering with excitement. I was not disappointed. You can't",1
" This film, directed by John Waters, is a bloody anti-hero movie, a hoot every bit as much as The Dirty Dozen.<br /><br />Just like the raucous comedy of Reel Big Fish, Waters' film is loaded with all the humor of its subjects. But it's the moral and emotional core of this piece that makes it truly",1
" I'll admit at this point that I haven't seen the movie before, but I am quite excited about it, and excited about the opportunity to see it again in the near future. ",1
" Believe it or not, I haven't seen this film, and as a result I didn't see it on the big screen. But if you know that this is a great movie, it deserves a second chance. Many of the pieces seem to be here to stay. This low-budget film could have easily been lost in the shuffle of last year's Miramax fest",1
" The film, which is in it's third year on the big screen, is a great example of the potential and power of the sex symbol. I would never think to find such a turn in a film ever that has me so highly delighted with a work of art. I could not in good conscience recommend this film, but it certainly is well worth a look if one is",1
" Yes, after 'High Noon' I was looking forward to this one. Not only is it a highly entertaining film, it's also moving and thoughtful, with some powerful scenes. ",1
" I recently saw Cocktail f/k the Clock on a post-New York production. The film is, hands down, a very good movie. It's not as good as the Broadway production, but it's a very good movie. It's a very good crime film, too. The only real problem it has is its running time. It takes a while to talk",1
" The importance of a good script and director to a production cannot be overstated, whether it be a film like ""The Magnificent Seven"" or a television series like ""The White Shadow."" In this regard, this is an issue in this case. Excellent written by a scriptwriter I'd compare to Tom Frost or Paul Schrader, but the bad script and director made a",1
" This is one of those film that I really hated to get into even though it is so unbelievably good. The greatest thing about it is that it's so well shot and the actors are just so strong. I think it's also just really a great film, not just a historical film. I find it outstanding and I'd watch it again.<br /><br />The",1
" This A-Team film is one of those that makes me wish that Julianne Moore had been in it. The movie feels good on television (that's what I love about this series), and in real life, with Moore's quiet but fiercely energetic performance. I was really glad to see her involved again, even if she's one of those characters - I almost miss that",1
" I really enjoyed this one, it seems to follow the same format as the previous film, but it does a better job of keeping you hooked and wanting to watch it a second time. ",1
" Well, I just finished watching it, and I can't say I enjoyed every part I saw. But the acting was excellent, especially the performances by the two lead female's. I thought that Joseph Gordon-Levitt was great as the young man who powers his way into this world. Quite often I find a risky movie to watch, especially one as good as this in",1
 This is a film that makes you feel like you need to sit down and read the script on paper. I can't remember the last time I watched a movie like this. ,1
 This monster movie trilogy is the continuation of the Sinatra-Conrad movie trilogy. The one outside of the Sinatra-Conrad celluloid trilogy may be the genuine entry that comes to mind. What's different about this film is the fact that they're not three films in one. The three films of the trilogy are separated by time. Black Snake Moan is the,1
" I don't know why I haven't already seen this movie. It's not bad, but I don't think I'll ever be able to watch it again. I think I'll tell you about it in a little bit, because it's gonna be a good one to watch. When Barry Mann and Roy Scheider, both of whom are older than me, are portraying",1
" I truly believe that this film has so much potential; so much of the way that it plays is so well done and so much of it is so well shot. But I just never had the idea of it at the time, and even when I did I never really really connected with it.<br /><br />It's a film about two people who find eachother",1
" If you are an avid watcher of Jeffrey Dean Morgan's work (and I am sure he will be), then you will want to read this review. This is one of the most beautifully crafted films I've seen in years, from the haunting cinematography to the songs and performances. In my opinion, this is by far the best film of the Grantland Rice Award-",1
" ""There are no judgments. You don't have to change your mind. There are no choices. You just have to act. Through a complex web of lies, threats, and betrayals, I don't see any way out of the situation except either to confess, to confess, to confess, or to say I'm sorry and leave."" —David N. Lapid",1
 I have seen this movie and even though I kind of knew who the killer was from the beginning I still liked watching it. I would recommend it to other people. It comes on Lifetime movie network quite a lot. And I am thinking since it's close to Halloween they might play it more. So please be on the look out for it if you are interested in watching it,1
" And don't forget that this movie is also a sequel to Bloody Saturday. And if you haven't seen it yet, you should do it. It's a blast, as the title might suggest, and is definitely worth seeing. . .unless you dont like strong women or man and are too feisty to take control of the audience, which goes with being a woman",1
" I heard it was on the air and then watched it last night at the TCM in Atlanta. I am in the business of finding out where movies are going to go so i never knew the movie was on the air in the first place. Anyway, this recent film is a story of two truly messed up characters, played by two really great actors. Sam Rockwell is",1
" I'm going to go out on a limb and say that I'm not even a movie buff, let alone a connoisseur. But I do know what I like to see on the big screen, and this is one of those films that will appeal to me. I'm hoping that I'm doing something right. The plot, on the other hand, is a",1
" 'Concho' is a little like 'Black Snake Moan,' but with too much alcohol in it. And one of the things that makes it so much better is that I hardly noticed it or, if I did, I was too drunk to see what was going on. What I did notice is the opening that I saw on the big screen (you know the one",1
" Better known as the film that spawned the phrase 'The Great Escape,' the story of an escapee from the Spenser's prison is a tale that has remained in a darkly-at first darkly-content state ever since its release in 1956. The story of what happened to the escapee is ultimately a story of redemption for a guy, with a killer intent on",1
" Before I try to analyze this, I must first get this out of the way before I start. I am a very subjective and emotional person. I actually dislike the film, and accept it. I think it's a wonderful film, and all of the reasons I don't like it. Also, I am not a big fan of movies which only include a bare minimum of",1

" I saw this set in theaters, and I found it perfectly acceptable. Yes, it is basically a big fat soft-porn drama that was a bit of a drag to see. I did not find it a good comedy. One of the first feels to go, and the other to go, is your time management in what time is spending on this movie. I know",1
" I first saw this film in the late 60's, and I have to say it was the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. You can see the blood in it, and I mean blood. There's some good stuff in there, but that's about it. It's pure sleaze. ",1
 I have only seen the film once and I have to say that I enjoyed it very much. It is a beautiful film and I love the film enough to revisit it again. ,1
 ,1
" Legendary musician and composer Joseph Kosher, producer of 'Lovers of the Bell,' stars in this nostalgic and affecting true story of the first young Jewish couple. The film was filmed in 1962, so you see the family in their homes. The effects of the age of photography as we know it, using negative and negative only, are not present. All of the possible situations",1
" I have been fortunate to see this show before, and it is fun to see the cast in its best shape. These days it's difficult to find a decent version of this movie, or even a film of its kind on a nationwide television network. I had only seen the film on TV (over the years) two times, and I haven't seen it on the big",1
" I just saw this for the second time and like the first time. I liked the guts and the irony. The movie takes place in the big city and is not well shot, but the last few scenes are still very interesting. The movie is about Faith (Jennifer Connelly), a young woman who is kidnapped by a bunch of crazy guys and then put in a prison that",1
 I liked this movie quite a bit. I liked the way that Jack Knight (Christopher Walken) was portrayed. I liked the way that the townspeople's fear of him was based on his hockey sense of the townspeople. I liked the way that the townspeople's fear of him was based on his ability to stay in the game whether it was as,1
" The film is basically another version of The Magnificent Seven, with a new storyline. Unlike the original, this film has a larger cast of characters, but the overriding theme is similar. Sure, the six wheeling is a little more intense than the last seven, but it is equally capable of being mundane and compelling. This is a great movie to see if you like horror",1
" In a time when we're so caught up in our own private dramas, we should all be grateful that this movie takes the time to remind us of the greatness of our community's ""self-defense"" efforts. This is a small silver-screen contribution to movie history. And I haven't seen it, so I can't say whether it was directed by Luis Bunuel",1
" This is a beautiful, beautifully filmed, deeply haunting piece of cinema from a great director. I have seen it 3 times and have not tried to put it in order. It is not as good as 'Double Indemnity,' a far better film, but still a good movie, which is why it has gotten a cult following. I also found it to be very well",1
" I haven't seen this movie, so I have no idea if it is any good. But I thought it was well-made and much better than I had expected. It is a revision of Shakespeare's play, and it is a short film. I have seen the original play three times, and this is pretty much a new version. Andrew Graham-Pallath has",1
" Unfortunately, the first time I heard this was before seeing it on video and I was left with a sad, terrible ghost of my own childhood memories. It was the day before Halloween, and I am supposed to get a ticket for my friends, and it's a dismal drab movie I'm sure they all saw this year. I was bored with the story so I went",1
" I've always been interested in this movie, but I didn't really know who the killer was until the finale of the last one. I almost did not finish it, but the last remaining scenes were so suspenseful and suspenseful, so you SHOULD finish the whole movie. The movie closes out with a final scene that reminds me of a final scene from 'Amusement",1
" I keep seeing reviews for this movie, not because they are bad but because it's a startling film that has extremely negative aspects that the movie industry, and Hollywood in general, almost never considers. The film is evil, a snarling, mean-spirited, darkly humorous disaster of the first order, kind of like 'Zits' or 'Bloodsucker',",1
" I saw it for the first time last night, and I guess I will be re-authoring the 'Thriller!' book. When I saw the title card for this film it said ""High Noon"" and I was surprised that this was the name of the movie that gave me the idea for Whos Who's Mel Gibson: The Last heist (best seller",1
" I never gave high marks to shark fin soup films, particularly those in which some of the fin's teeth were missing, or which were made from macabre images of the human body. But it's a good thing I did. This is a dirty picture; the shark really looks like this. I would, however, make the reservation that this film does not capture the essence",1
" This was a very strange movie for me to see, even though I usually do very odd things to make sure my friends and family know who I am. I find it difficult to watch this because like the other movies I've mentioned, it actually does remind me of a few sadistic shows that I saw in the late 60s. In this case, it is the clown",1
" I saw 'High Noon' here today and I was blown away. I thought it was a great movie and really enjoyed it. I didn't know that the cowboy was a real person. The story was well told, the acting great, and the music was equally good. The only thing I don't like about the movie is the ending. It could have been brilliant,",1
" The movie is not truly a movie, but a performance piece. There are no performances that are all that good. That said, I was very surprised by the significance of this film in the development of the Jewish theatre scene in the Midwest (along with other types of theatrical entertainment). Berdycki may be the most important, but his performance is rather one-dimensional - a",1
" The only bad thing I can say about this movie is that I'm not a huge fan of this particular version of Shakespeare's play. The performances are not bad, but I can't stand the idea of the city people, especially the Jewish people, being driven to do the things the goons were doing in the movie, which was to take all the Jews out of the",1
" I don't know why I couldn't wait this long to see this, but I did. I heard Tom Cruise's name mentioned and thought that he was the warm and fuzzy narrator. Instead, I was treated to a film that wasn't really about Tom Cruise, but at least was pretty good. The film did a few things that reminded me some of the issues that now",1
" When I saw this in the theater, I merely had to wait two full minutes before the film had a chance to begin. It certainly had plenty of time. As for the actors, they were all very good. The supporting cast was nothing short of fantastic; I'm not sure if they all played together in the movie but all look very similar. In a few scenes I",1
" Long before John Ford's ""Out of the Silent Planet,"" the same idea was expressed in the 1920's by the brothers Lawrence and Charles Chaplin. Now both movies have been remade in film. These are two of my favorite movies, and I love them both. I'd love to see a remake of these movies, but the studio prefers to cast actors who are better",1
" A girl is kicked out. Shortly thereafter, she is the target of a serial killer. The killer is obsessed with his first victim, a young woman who she believes is his daughter. She is in the cab of a car that is traveling to a mortuary where she is going to be buried. His mind is shattered the moment she's hit by a car. With a",1
" The film was quite good. As I said above, I was expecting this to be better than the first film. But like I said, I was expecting more of a neo-noir type of movie. This time it actually wasn't that bad. It's not great but it is okay. I will say that the script itself was rather good. I knew the story",1
" One of my favorite movies in a long time. It's not a film I've seen every single time I've seen it, but if I'm feeling serious, I might do it every time. I love it when horror goes from being scary into being this level of entertainment. Such a great film. The acting is great. ",1
" This movie is not the best one I have seen lately. It is not bad in any way, but it does have some flaws. It's about a young woman who is a car thief and a man who wants her to marry him. I don't think they were real people, and I don't know if they were even real people. But it was too early in",1
" I saw this movie at the theater, and it was excellent. In spite of being a quick film, it is a very good concept. It is a comedy about a man who lost his wife and his son and the people who ruined his life. In a way, it is a picture of the late depression. There are a small number of people who become more malicious and",1
" I enjoyed The Sound of My Heart more than I thought I would. I think that is because I liked director John Callea's last movie, and I liked seeing a more mature version of him. In this movie, his character is very simple, but he is also very realistic. The film itself is actually very well made and the soundtrack is excellent. ",1
" Good story, good acting, good characters, good direction, very well done. Is ""Thoroughbred"" dating a movie that's turned my girlfriends on? ",1
" A beautiful FX film. Directed by Fred Zinnemann and starring Jason Robards. As a former model and actress, his wife has been sick for about years now. She's in the middle of the hospital and can't come home to see her son who's waiting outside. This is a family movie. Jason is a very handsome young man with blond hair,",1
" I've never seen this movie before because I've never heard of it. I kind of struggled to pick it up but now I'm watching it and am really enjoying it. But then I stopped thinking about it because I found out that it's based on William S. Burroughs book. I don't necessarily endorse everything in it, but I think it's worth an",1
" This is a horror movie. It's not a comedy either, but it may just be the most fun horror movie I've ever seen. Jason Priestley does an excellent job. He seems to be the only person in the movie who is against the killer. He is a little old but that's okay. I can't believe how close together they are. And they all",1
" I've been interested in this film for some time now, but it took me a while to realize that it was a fake. I figured I would give it a try anyway. This film is inspired by the George W. Bush...do you remember that?? ",1
" I agree that the film is extremely poor and I know that I am probably not the only one who noted the same thing. I don't know what happened to this film in the movies and how much support during production there was. If you liked It, I Hope you liked it too. ",1
" When I saw this movie I was mostly worried. I was worried I would like the movie less than I did. But I did not. It was a nice, sad, and serious film. There are no better words to describe this story. If you are a person who loves the ocean, like I love the ocean, or like I like the ocean, then this movie",1
 This is the first time since Looney Tunes II when I have seen a film that I have been really interested in. It's a film that wants to entertain and satisfy but it comes at you as a very ugly and dirty movie. I think they need to do a better job with the dialogues and the action. This movie just seems odd and didn't make me,1
" I watched this movie last night and I think it had an interesting plot, just in a different way than the original. I think they could have done a better job of creating the reader's mind with the idea of a young, poor girl who spends her life in a loveless house. But the cleverness of this film was missing. And that was a nice",1
 I'm really sad that this movie has been wiped off the American Network. I've been waiting for this film since I first heard about it. I thought that the movie did not do as well as I had hoped. But after seeing the trailer I was extremely wrong. I was taken into a really dark and scary place. I loved everything about this movie. I thought it,1
" A lot of movies come along and you like them. But when you plan to watch them a lot, is it wise? I would say no. A lot of movies just don't really appeal to me. I like a good story and a good message. And I don't feel that I get to see what other people think about a movie. This movie worked for me",1
" What a good film! A great concept album of the Beatles' ""Yellow Submarine."" Sure, I am not a Beatles fan, but I think they are cool. I think that these songs are pretty good. The theme song is really good. ",1
" I am a big fan of the Eric Roberts character in the movie ""The Blair Witch Project."" I have seen the movie three times. I didn't really like it initially but I have been a fan of the movie for a while now. They get in some nice action shots. It's a pretty good movie. It was not very good for me. It was kind of",1
" I think it's a beautiful movie. It plays like a narrative play, but with a more serious edge to it. This is the first time that I saw one of the picture's for the first time. It was hilarious,reat,which was the movie. I love watching a movie like this. Also, I think it's the best movie I've seen in the",1
" Some movies are just a chore to watch. - What's it going to be like, what's gonna happen, what's gonna happen? Killing a guy off? - Who'da thunk it, huh? The same goes for the great Alfred Hitchcock's films. What Hollywood needs is an idea to carry the ball, and get it off the ground. The sound levels",1
" This is a new kind of production featuring the first Turkish cast. I am not sure that this is a very good first film for Turkish actors. But it is worth seeing. Besides, for the original cast, the new cast is better than the old. The new cast is older, even more talented, and has a great sense of humor as well as a little Syrian soul",1
" I am a huge fan of TIFF, but I used to dislike the Toronto International Film Festival. This year I saw a movie named ""The Master of Ballantyne"" near the front of the festival. It had a nice story, and was a nice little movie. As it was starting out (and extremely cliché) I knew that this was going to be okay,",1
" Speaking of Shakespeare, this is not the first time we've seen a movie about him. It's been done (for the most part) before in several countries. But here it's the first time that scriptwriters have attempted to have a play of Shakespeare in the form of a movie. The story is well-written enough to get through to the audience. It's a",1
" I found the film somewhat disappointing. It seems like a big production from the first 10 minutes. It is not self explanatory that this film is a parody of the great emphasis on the importance of being attractive. A few scenes seem to have been heavily filmed. The use of computer-generated images is distracting, and may be seen as a ruse to put off viewers, since",1
" A strange New York neighborhood of the 1930's is shown through the eyes of the lead character. I actually thought that this was a terrible idea. Although this is the first interpretation of the play that I actually liked, I think it would have been better, allowing the director to show us what he wanted to show. But, for the first time, we see the view from",1
" An interesting interpretation and presentation of the past. The story is split into three sections: the tragic story of King Lear, a tale that we often associate with Shakespeare; comedic and tragic tales of King Richard II; and the great-grandfathers ofHenry IV, also known as King Richard I.",1
" I'm not surprised that the first movie in this popular series of films (following ALIENS) was a sleeper hit. It bears similarities in tone and style to the popular cult classic THE LAST MAN ON EARTH. But it is also a bit different in its premise - the story of a group of stranded astronauts in a post-apocalyptic space, who must find",1
" This is a good, little movie. The acting is actually good, and I liked the script. It's not that it's difficult to see how the movie succeeds, but it has a very conventional structure, and I think that the actors play the characters, rather than the events, well enough. It's no wonder that it got a positive review from the Daily Mail.",1
 The character of Shylock is an extremely entertaining anti-hero in this film.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br,1
" Not only may the content be realistic, but the acting is also. Actually, this makes it a bit better than most of the other movies I've seen recently. It's funny, but it's also realistic in the way the characters are made out to be if they are the victims of the world's cynical, corrupt, and uncharismatic rulers. I don't",1
" We're not talking violent, bloody crime here. This sweet, funny film about a young man's decision to leave the pining, dejected state of his marriage after his wife's death and follow the career of an opera singer, takes us a little deeper into the human psyche than most, or at least a few, of the films we have recently seen. Perhaps a",1
" This was the first of the two sequels to the popular 1970s-era film, ""The Special Unit,"" and it was the first movie that starred Al Pacino. It is set in the year 2044, and the story follows a team of heroic agents (in this case, the trained operatives) on a mission which must take them into the S.U.T",1
" It is a pity that the movie ""The Great Escape"" was not made before this one. Not because of the fantastic gore (which is the case with all of them), but because it would've benefited the movie in the eternal search for the true story. And you would have gotten it. It's just so terrible. The story is ludicrous. It's a metaphor for",1
" I was excited to see the film adaptation of the Danish film ""September to June."" While I've seen a lot of Swedish films, I've never seen anything like this. The film is beautifully filmed in beautiful landscapes, with excellent camera work, dialogue, and a well-developed mood. The story is simple, but the actors are superbly cast. The only problem I",1
" I was drawn to the name ""İscalı"" (from Turkey) by the lovely language in the title. Actually, this film is a joint effort with the Turkish film industry as a whole, with both directors and actors playing Turkish roles. And the film is the first-run release of a new production - in this case, a Turkish-language version.",1
" Everything in this movie is so good it's almost impossible to dislike it. It's only a matter of time until someone will get a hold of it and start to see the possibilities of a movie like this. The actors in it are so good, and their chemistry with real actors is so real, it's quite impressive. The script is good, the story is well done",1
" I think that the best American work of Art should be those of Americans, rather than European. The main reason for the movie's success is its cultural timing, with its easy-to-understand dialogue, fast-paced action, and good external shots. Much of the cast is unfamiliar to me, but the actors don't let me down either, with the exception of",1
" I am surprised that no one has ever come up with the idea of making a modern-day version of Shakespeare's masterpiece. Superficially, it seems as though the movie is in the shape of the old-fashioned classic film The Merchant of Venice, with a twist. The film takes place during a time of dramatic social upheaval, with life and reputation in shamb",1
" Trying to see a new movie not too bad, but it makes you feel terrible. It's not very good. The movie stars Reese Witherspoon as a green-eyed, blond-haired, blue-eyed, isis-wearing, Australian woman, and two ridiculous Vietnamese boy-band singers. People (and women) are definitely living in a different era",1
" I was sure I wouldn't like this movie, the reviews say that it is a "" Poor man's "" "" a "" romantic comedy "" "" "" "" and I was totally wrong, the movie is not that. It is a movie of small characters mainly because every character has his or her own reason for their actions. All the characters are singing and dancing to themselves and the",1

" The most intense scenes took place in the theme park, where they lived, both in a feverish excitement and bitter cold, and his eyes glowed at the reflection of a red-hot window. The almost sexual scenes with both of these girls are so unique, to witness someone you usually not really know or familiar with this very often makes you feel ashamed and sad. I",1
 I loved the language! The actual Spanish I fell in love with. I could feel the passion and excitement. And the great performance by Barbra Streisand. The lead actress is taking great care to show her emotions. ,1
" Like all my friends who watch this movie, I saw the first preview of it, and I felt very disappointed by the imagery. As I began to see the movie, and realised that it was not as violent as it seemed, I was very pleasantly surprised. I immediately got into this movie and was very impressed by the actors. All the actors are so well cast in this",1
" It is the best movie on acting I have ever seen. All the artists are old Turkish theater actors, they are magnificent in this movie. It is sometimes said that ""They do not act, they live it"", you can really see this in this movie. The director is also competent, you cannot see lots of moving cameras around but the positions of the cameras are also good",1
" This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. We need to change our political thinking to be more realistic about our society. This is a movie about the relationships between people, including organized religion, relationships with people, even relationships with each other, our planet, and the way that we use it all. It is a movie about love, relationships, understanding, trust",1
" The film has its problem, it was too soon, and it's boring. The story is too easy to follow and not enough depth to be interesting. The women are young, and exaggerate their sexuality, which is normal in 20's and 30's. It's weird, especially since the movie has its controversy about how much porn is portrayed in the film, and it",1
" What a cheap shot! To tell you the truth, I thought that a lot of the film was too dirty. I was surprised to see that the movie was shot in a lot of different scenes ,and that the director has made this movie in the style of a porn film. I also thought the film was not very good, not because of the movie itself but because of",1
" This is a great movie! What she did was so beautiful, and what she was doing was so mysterious and wonderful! It really is very creative and fascinating! It seems that the director has really escaped from the old movie industry and is now doing the new way! It is really a joy to watch a movie like this.<br /><br />My only complaint is that",1
" This movie is a very enjoyable movie. It's funny, realistic and very entertaining. The movie is made by a nice young director, pay attention to his style of directing. This is how one can see a whole movie being made by one person. The movie is in my opinion the best movie on acting I have ever seen in recent years. This is where one gets a",1
" I found this to be a good movie to watch, to see the antics of the sea; its funny and cute, the girl is not likeable and even the captain is just a character they just have to like to watch. They seem to be quite unlike the usual cast of film, and the movie has a vintage feel to it. I liked the scenes of the ship",1
 This is a very pleasant surprise when I found out how fairy tale comes to life. It's full of heartwarming and powerful stories that seem to be true and help you to feel happy. I was really amazed when I realized how a simple story about a girl who knew a certain doctor and wanted to marry him sounds like a mature fairy tale. It is a story about searching,1
" I considered the reason why I watched this film, and I was not disappointed. I thought that the energy in Avril's face was completely portrayed and her attitude was fitted. This was a film that was not to be missed. I thought that I liked Avril because she was curvy, and her breasts were not so high. That makes a beautiful woman, I think",1
" I was going to write a two part review, but the movie left me with the impression that it is just a soap opera type of movie. You can see the young muse of the god-like painter with a little too many words, but he is also a bisexual, she has plenty of free time, she is a beautiful woman, and she is a drunkard.<",1
" When I first saw the movie, I thought it was a very boring film.The plot was not interesting, there was no mystery of the undercover agent in a boat in the middle of the sea, just a bunch of people in low-cut dresses dancing and singing that sounds really nice in the sea. It's probably the best sad movie I ever saw ",1
" A movie is an encyclopedia of things that happened in Hollywood, a novel is a collection of elements that can make a movie work. I hope the people who are watching this movie will like it. I had a part in the movie (like in the movie). It was fun to watch the girls dancing with the guys, we all know how it is to be with a girl",1
" You are watching a man with a Russian accent, being the kind of guy who would rather be played by a Japanese actress. It's hard to keep your mouth shut when you don't have a sense for female emotions. I thought the movie was amazing, it seemed so realistic. It's not the most traditionally beautiful film in relation to its era, but I thought it was",1
" I have a love for Shakespeare but it took me a while to end up this way.<br /><br />This was one of those movies that made me laugh so much, I was crying with laughter too. It was a cute film, with a surprising number of plot twists, and a very charming story. A very entertaining that i would recommend it to anyone. And",1
 I enjoyed the movie. I thought it was a nice looking movie. I also liked the acting. I liked how it annoyed people and made me want to laugh. I loved the adventure of the sailor ; he was really entertaining. Another lame subplot was the fact that a sailor could only have a girl in the family. It was nice to see the sailor cutting off his,1
" One of my favorites. The director is a wonderful guy. It is such an emotional movie, and the actors are wonderful. It is not realistic, but it is a story that I would never have thought of and I enjoyed it very much. I am glad the film got a NC-17. ",1
" I think its a shame she didn't get screen credit , she by far did the best job in the film has the girl on the cross , best part of the movie .She had much more impact than Avril , or just about anyone else in the film . She almost made S/M look like fun ! She really was believable has the S/M model that gets",1
" I was a little disappointed in this movie. It was very good, but I was expecting something a little darker and grimmer. I really enjoyed the film but I think I am a little disappointed in the movie overall. There were a few scenes that I liked, but not all of them. I think it was necessary for the movie to get rid of the dead character,",1
" Drama Romance Comedy . Rejection . A great film with a good script, not much action but the actors make up for it. Its a fun movie to see and its a great way to pass the time. ",1
" I haven't read the book , but I've seen the movie. It is an excellent film in its own right, but the best part is the quality of the acting by everybody - from the young actors to the old ones. The film is fast paced and exciting. The performances by the cast are superb, even better than the movie.<br /><br />I rate",1
" Example of a film of this kind: "" The Wizard of Oz "". <br /><br />This movie is not much of a movie. The acting is really not bad. The story is the same as the others, although the events in the story are different. But the acting is pretty good. As for the movie's content, it has the same film as the",1
" ...this movie is the best one I have seen in a long time. It's amazing how great the acting is in this movie. And there are a lot of great female roles. But I love the one in the film called ""The Woman In Black"" too. It's so sad. I know there are a lot of people who thought the movie was one of the",1
" Yes. You can choose whether you are glad or not, many people just are, and some people are not so glad. If it is sad, you probably agree about this. If you think it is bad, you probably agree too. I really think it is bad. RIP, John. You have some kind of disease that would take me to hell in a hand basket",1
 My brother and I both loved this film. It was dark and lonely and a worthy watch. It was scary too. I think you should gosee this again.<br /><br />I think the movie is going to be a staple of the summer for a long time to come. ,1
 Just a pleasure to watch this movie. The actors are superb. It is also a pity that this is a comedy. ,1
" This is a movie that I had wanted to see since I was a little girl. I wanted to go to a theater and see a concert-concert by Waylon Jennings. Now I know the truth of the matter. I saw ""Let me tell you about a girl."" I was NOT expecting the film to be bad. The plot line, director, and the performances were",1
" It shows the love of the human potential, the desire to live. It's what makes men and women happy. Its what makes people happy when they live. Its what makes anybody happy. Every person should see this movie. It must be on your list of the most famous films to see. ",1
" This movie is incredible and you will love it. It is a must see. It is the best movie on acting that has ever been made. I will not lie , I was scared when I heard about the remake but once I saw it, I was tingling all over my body. It is the best movie I have ever seen in my life. ",1

I really like the director's planning in this movie. Most of the scenes are not that long, and they don't do them as often would like, but they do them well. Most of",1

" It was honestly one of the best films i've ever seen, and not just because it was based on a book. The movie is a dream come true, and is absolutely gorgeous! Its very unique, and you can feel the energy on the set, and in the audience. I LOVED IT, and I'm in such a positive mood today because I saw it",1
" “When the sun goes down, the sun will go down with it” was the opening line of this film which allowed me to feel a little nostalgic for this film by the end of the first act. I really liked the character of The Joker in this film. I liked The Joker a lot and thought he was the perfect villain in the film. The Joker in",1
" They knew how to have real adult characters with a different personality and an adult dream to go along with it. I think the addition of young daughter Kerry made this film for me , because I think Kerry is just so refreshing , very well balanced and likable as well. I think she has the witty voice and a self-confidence and intelligence that is really refreshing to have in",1
 I haven't had a chance to listen to this one yet but i'm hoping that it will be good. Well its a very good show. S/M is in the news now and one of the people on this show talks about S/M in the news. But the show is classified for M/M and the musician in it is probably a m/f.,1
" For the people on this site, i would like to say welcome to the life of the british ! You haven't been on my radar for a while. I think you may be wondering why, or what, I haven't made a review so far. I think that you have been in a movie that you've really enjoyed and you are looking for something to say",1
" It was my daughter and her friend talking about the show, I was having a hard time of it, so I told her how I felt about it and she said she had to see it to tell me what I would think.<br /><br />But I really liked it, and its a great film about a family that you really should understand about the way things work",1
" This film was okay, the story was excellent but the acting was mediocre. It was a far better film directed by Jim Jarmusch(Man on Fire) than it is director John Sobrow . Now I will admit that the actors were all decent but Jay was the best star out of the bunch the film rhe film was just okay . I would have liked for",1

 I thought the movie was alright to hear the story of an alcoholic family that is trying to make it in the big city. It had the look of a movie I thought would be a bit too 'meow meow' to watch. I also thought Ritter was underplayed as the sadist that is killing the family. If I had to choose a negative point about,1
" This is a great R, so true to what it says on the box, if you haven't seen it in theaters yet you've been mislead. This is a great film. Pretty good for a movie that has got so many scenes in it that need to be seen in theaters. The story is about two brothers who were at a funeral and the father sees a woman in",1
" Now comes the bad news, because its not like I'm afraid of DARKEST HISTORY and its not like I'm afraid of the movies in general. The movie is very infantilizing to some extent, but I'm glad a few things came out of the woodwork, and I'm glad that its a film about respect for life. And I have to say that",1
" Robert Patten's Riddick was a good film. I enjoyed it, but that is not saying much because there were so many other films that were better and it was a good idea to make a sequel. I went into it very apprehensive because it was the first Riddick film I had seen and I was not happy with the trailer. I had seen the",1
" I think if you like that movie check out this one, it has some great scenes and great performances. The Michael O'Neill is actually pretty funny, you'll be tempted to join him on a date. ",1
" This movie is a great movie, I recommend it to everyone, it is really funny. ",1
" This movie is a bit of a mess. The plot is pretty basic but the acting is great as is the script. The actors keep you guessing every second of the film. Even the main character is very funny, but that's about it. Meryl Streep's voice is just as strong as the actors' on the screen. There is SO MUCH that can be done",1
" Great film....I give it a 9/10 /10<br /><br />the story is great, the acting is great , the special effects are great, the direction is great, the story is great with a great loose plot with many twists and turns as well as some great performances. I love this film, its just like a noir film with a lot",1
 I know I haven't posted a review for this movie in a while but I can honestly say that I fell in love with this film more than or maybe even more than I did with the first two movies.

" This was the first film that I saw of director John Crowley's new film, and I had to say this show had the best I have seen of him in many years. It is well made, clever, emotionally devastating, and sets a great tone for this genre. The director did a great job directing the first few scenes in this film, and then gave more creepiness",1
" When it comes to Robert Altman re-teaming with his son, the animated specials, you'd think it would be the Rocky series, but in this case it's the The Wild Bunch. This show is all about the family. From the moment we meet the mother holding their infant baby, we learn it is a miracle he's alive. ",1
" I watched THE NEW YORK DAILY NEWS through the rainy afternoon, and was very pleasantly surprised by the cast. I wasn't expecting to see John Turturro in the role of Charlie Watts, but he was perfect with the role.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the special roster of actors and actresses that were part of the cast, from Mel Gibson to U",1
" At the end of the show, Cate says to her daughter, ""You look happy. Good for you now, you got good."" I will never forget that statement. I will never forget what Cate said to her daughter. Cate was the coolest daughter in the history of the world! I thought it was great to see her teary eyed and tell her daughter",1
" I'm a huge movie fan (I'm Japanese) and I'm a huge fan of the more recent films on the list. However, I was a little disappointed in this one. Some of the elements were impressive, but the plot and characters were just a bit too predictable. The plot was predictable, the characters were predictable, and the plot was predictable. The plot was",1

It was the first show of the evening and one of the funniest bits of the evening was when one of the gangre saw a naked guy in a guys underwear. This pushed him over the edge of his emotional operating system and he",1
" Here is a good film. Its a must see. The acting is very good and the story is well thought out with action and suspense. But the best part of the movie are the characters. I was very happy to see the success of Ronnie Corbett's in his film ""The King's Speech"" ",1

" I'm a big fan of James Spader, but I needed a break from him this time, so I was totally delighted when he was cast as Langdon Whitney's right hand man. The story dealt with the working class issues of helping those in need, however in this case, it also dealt with the class issues of a couple whose relationship you can see at times is",1
 This was really good. It's a good comedy that does a good job of poking fun at the movie industry. I thought it was a fun and entertaining show. I think its great that you can have a laugh at how much money they spend on actors when they don't even bother casting them. You have to be able to buy into the commercial nature of the show to,1
" A beautiful, calming, just-you-mean-it take on the world. 'the fire that I am' couldn't be rated higher. <br /><br />The last six or so minutes of the movie tell the truth, portraying us as just a few emotions swirling about in our heads, caving us into the darkness. The simple call to action,",1
 This film is about the people who were living in the second half of the 20th century. The film starts with an interview of a young guy who comments and reminisces about things that he didn't even remember in the era of television. It is also about the people of the state of Oklahoma which is a far cry from the '90's. It is also not about,1
" One of the most underrated things about this film is the chemistry among the actors. There is not a single scene that is not shot well, and I'm generally not a big fan of the original. I would love to see a remake of this, but of course, that would be a big investment. In this film, they are just great people who just want to make",1
" If you haven't seen this film, GO SEE IT. I was amazed. It is both funny and sad. There are all the heart attacks, death and stuff that you CAN'T help but enjoy. If you don't like it, then don't see it. <br /><br />I don't think I've ever seen a film like this. There",1
 One of the best film theatre attractions ever! The best in the UK and a must see for fans of comedy films. Every part of the show is on the level but the story and the execution is incredible! People leave the theatre amazed and again with a smile on their face. The cast does a great job with the script and the story of the film. I was really,1
" Question: Do you have to be in an action film to be a good action film? Answer: Yes. Question: Do you have to be a movie star to be a good movie star? Answer: No. But if a book is a good book, a movie is a great movie. Question: Is the film ""The Hit"" The Hit? Answer: Yes.",1
" I'll say it up front, I'm a fan of Mandy Patinkin and I don't mind seeing his character get some angst. If you think Mandy Patinkin is the epitome of acting that he's acted before, you're wrong. This is a really great return to form. ",1
" This weirdo goofy drama is a great odd mix of comedy and drama, which in turn is sort of a strange mix of restorative and painful. The comedy consists of a story about a young couple's attempted suicide, an attempt that turns into an ugly, pointless experiment. The drama involves a lovely young couple who want to be a family again. ",1
" A haunting, immersive mystery! Peter Farrelly and Lee Evans star in this exceptional, intelligent, yet unproduced, Portland, Oregon-set mystery/horror film. The story revolves around a personal tragedy that haunts the lives of two young men; a young man who was found dead in his bathroom and a young woman who is in therapy for what appears to be a",1
 What can i say...this film is good<br /><br />Good cast. Good story line. Good direction. Good acting. Good Editing. Some movement. Good production. Good soundtrack. ,1
" A comedy of ideas, told in such a breezy way that it doesn't seem like there's any remoteness from the outrageousness of the characters. Even the characters are given a voice. One of the best films in the varsity sport of TV. Even with all the ""techniques"" used it still felt like a movie. I would recomend it",1
" When I first heard the news that a tech company owned by the men who killed my mum have bought the rights to make a film about the death of my mum, I was genuinely shocked because it seemed so out of touch.

As a 25 year old, my favourite movie of all time was 'A Man for All Seasons,' and then I watched 'The Fan' just now. I was surprised that 'The Fan' in hindsight is such a great movie, because",1
" This is a movie that will have you dancing with the motion picture bug. The story is simple: A sheriff confronts a woman about the murder of his wife and brother. The movie is good and it makes you want to dance, but it is not a typical western. This film is about a sheriff, two men, a woman and a horse.<br /><br />",1
" That is what I've heard about this film. As the film begins it's clear that it's about a crime and it's about the perpetrators. Funny, and thought provoking.

" Well, I guess I would like to say that I am sorry that I did not like this film it was so good. Bertrand Tavernier is one of the best actors of our time and he made a movie that was really good. I would like to see a movie with more of his characters but i dont think this is done right. The film was probably one of",1
 It seems a shame that the great Benny Hill made such a small contribution to this film. He seems to have been a bit on the other side of the tracks. Perhaps this is karma for the terrible standards he set. The film itself does manage to be funny - most of the time. It might not be as good as the short films found in the book but its certainly,1
" The first time I saw this movie it left a bad taste in my mouth. What happened to ""the best chance there was"" to come out of a film house?

 I think this is a new and unique type of film. It is a film about a guy who starts to go insane after meeting a woman. Robert Carson plays a mental patient who is being cared for by a man and a mentally ill man named Lonnie. They both try to kill each other but that turns out to be difficult. I liked this film because it had a,1
" If you're a fan of The Godfather trilogy or the (then) cult classic Casablanca, you'll be able to appreciate the dramatically and narratively novelizing narrative of The Ascension.

" When the fabled Russian and Soviet Union of The Great Patriotic War (aka the Second World War) came to the nation of USA, its role in world political relations was somewhat ceremonial and the time of the civil war in that country's southern republics was 'behind the curtain' as well.

" The newest release of the critically acclaimed collection of Russian and Soviet humor is The Ascension, an Italian film about the transition of military education and the culminating of a new generation. The critics had a field day with the film, and it's pretty funny in places. The main cast is strong, and the script is inventive, but the execution is a bit disappointing. The film's",1

" This is Joel Coen and Ethan Coen's most impressive film to date. It is a modern comedy with a returning cast of great performers like Tim Curry, Alan Arkin and James Coburn.

" Not a lot of films are currently making it to DVD, but the Soviet Union's forces during World War II are amongst the finest in films. If you are looking for an interesting narrative about the war, this is the film to see. Drawing heavily on the work of Andrei Tarkovsky, the director _comes out with a great story to tell. We have the",1
" On the surface, the film appears quite straightforward, and with only two characters who are being held captive by the Nazis, the producers decided to make it more interesting overall by simultaneously adding in an old Polish story line for certain and a new one for the other. However, more than just the fact that the two characters are confined to a basement, the background of the story is",1

Although the movie definitely has its moments, the story had me glued to my TV! The",1
" This is a brilliant film that will make anyone who hasn't seen it cry. I agree with the other comments. There was a time I was so enamored with this movie that I kept it on my night stand just to watch it over and over again. I was even tempted to buy the DVD. My wife loved it, and I was very flattered but still",1
" I am a fan of the film, but this film is just more of the same pre-Citizen Kane kind of film. At least for me, it doesn't belong in the house of a movie-goer, even if it is the standard of quality of the film. This film is just a copycat copy of Citizen Kane and its Hollywood rival Abhandl",1
" A good film to add to your collection, but not one I would recommend to my friends, this film is far too violent for its own good.

The masterful camera work is used to accomplish an",1
" I am going to roll my eyes and say that I am a big fan of the movie, and its unique world of films that are somewhat like alternate reality movies.

" Gripping and emotional, this film is an odd and haunting adventure. Hamlet, in the form of a complex and cryptic mystery, takes up a dark and personal story, which is expertly told by lead actor Nikolai Bektselev. The movie is a moving portrayal of the character of Hamlet, under the influence of the vampire king, the Count of",1
 This is a good movie to close out the year. I must say that I have not seen a non-Dahmer movie in this year. I was actually surprised the first time I saw it. It is a film that has probably never been seen by the general public. I can't say that I would recommend it as a general audience viewing....but I think it,1
" Well, the movie ""Hold Tight"" wasn't bad, and I had a good time watching it. It was a rare example of a film being ""Gone With the Wind"" and having a good time as well. The romance was played out with a very ""nice girl"" type heroine, and it was quite nice to see how the rest of the film unfolded.",1
" Interesting idea for a film to have, but I found this to be neither one. The result of the film is a very hollow mess, with no semblance of life or humor. Perhaps one of the best films of the year.

This does not make it worth the $6.00 you pay to rent it. I have never seen it, and I was awfully blindsided by the review...at first. FAST FIVE STARS!! RE",1
" If the above is all too depressing for you, I think you will find this wonderfully produced film instructive, both in terms of its sense of humor, drama, and the end results of the situation. This is one of those rare films which brings out the best in its subject matter, and the most pitifully underutilized ""side effects"" of war. The fact",1
" I was not surprised to hear that Woody Allen was developing a film based on the life of a marine who perished on the USS Yorktown off the coast of Virginia.

It is also a much loved film, a great performance by Nicholas Fridman and an excellent film, in my opinion. It is only now that I can appreciate",1
" It's somewhat of a miracle that a film as challenging as The Art of War, which I took a couple of years to review, didn't make it into any of the foreign release charts, since it's such a good film. The Art of War was directed by the charismatic Leo DiCaprio, and was the first of his films not to star Leonardo DiCaprio",1
" A wonderful film. The ten-minute performance of Joseph Madsen in his first starring role is outstanding. The music is haunting and yet soothing at the same time. The film makes excellent use of the lack of lighting by the light, and the slow panning and slow shutter speeds. I really enjoy this movie. I am amused to see the German days in which the Soviet",1
" I am a sucker for a good story about a former Russian soldier who serves in a POW camp. It can be a bit vague, and vague is the word of the day, and so the descriptions of the camp and the life of the POW's are fairly vague, to say the least. The story of the Soviet Union, and the atrocities committed by the Nazis as they",1
" I have not seen this movie again, but I have no doubt that Stinky's tour of Iraq brought me a new appreciation for Hamlet. The film takes you on a journey that at first takes you through the environment and then slowly takes you into the mind of Hamlet himself. This film is not a great film, but it is a fine example of the production of",1
" I had hoped to like this film, but was disappointed. I realize that the film is shot in black and white, and that the actors are actors. The performances are fine, but the scenes that are interesting and moving are the very ones that are depicted. The film shows the devotion and the sacrifices of the two-man team, but there is too much manipulation and too",1
" This is the sequel to 1995's ""Oh, Lord! What a Way to Die!"" and ""God Bless the Child."" Director Ivan Pavlovsky's version stars a lithe, young American and a young Russian.

" Well, watching the final 5 minutes of this film, I should have expected that there would be some time for a show-stopper. Since I was actually watching ""The Seven Deadly Sins"" and the ending was so anticlimactic, I was not sure how much of the film could be expected to remain a series of brief scenes. But the movie excelled as",1
" How well does John Williams contribute to the score? How well does any musician bring the power and definition of a composer to his performances? He can create entire themes and sections of music that sound natural, coherent, and full of emotion. This is demonstrated in the incredibly complex, diverse and energetic score to ""Apocalypse Now."" This film is about a revolution that is being staged",1
 This week's Cineaste Podcast has delivered the great news that HBO is producing a new film -- The Ascents of Man -- that is to be directed by Larisa Shepitko.

" I think the underrated Cabaret! was a great film in its day - hilarious, sly, awkward, and funny. The film and director are also best remembered for their ""Famous Last Words"" series of films (1972, 1974, 1975), which also featured Gene Kelly. Cabaret! was the last in the series, and was a big hit. The plot was",1
" Nowhere has a filmmaker been as slick as Andrei Tarkovsky in this masterpiece, a film which is much more than a slick teaser, and a rather good one. Without giving anything away here, the film concerns its leading men in the most authentic way. And this is what makes the film so compelling - it is authentically and profoundly about their respect and respect for",1
" This is not a film directed by Philip Kaufman, it is a film directed by Jim Dale. I had not heard of this film until it was released. There were three reasons I should invest in Dale's work: 1.) The film is mediocre. Though the storyline is (what I believe) familiar, the quality of the movie is average. This is not a bad film",1
" I received the Blu-ray of ""The Ascension"" - later than expected since it has been awhile since I have seen it. Well worth seeing. The film is probably the best performance by an actor I have heard of in theaters in a long time. The acting is what makes the movie. It is hard to really put into words how well the film portrays a Russian immigrant",1
" Although the stars are not quite as one might expect (Jay Baruchel, and Liv Tyler), the film features an Academy Award-winning cast and one of the most accurate recreations of the Soviet Union since the original German version was shot in the 1960s. The Soviet Union was relocated from area to area within the US-occupied USSR during the second World War, and",1
" This was a great follow-up to 'The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner.' It was enjoyable, though not as inspirational as the first. The story is the same, but the characters are slightly constructed on the Russian/German/Swiss model. The two main characters being Corporal, and L'der. These are the flawed people that, despite their hardships",1
" I have always associated Hamlet with Shakespeare. His famous soliloquy concerns the choices of his characters at the end of the play in Hamlet's castle where he is grievously wounded. The audience is treated to some of the most terrifying imagery of the movie, and Hamlet's physical condition as it is close to death seems to be deeply symbolic of the soul subjected",1
" Not available in the US or UK. A small production company in the Soviet Union produced this film, where two brothers, Alexander and Sergey, who had been put on the run in the Soviet armed forces, flee to the US in a time of war.

" I've seen The Big Picture, The Intruder. A great documentary with the supporting cast of John Krasinski as a therapist, actor Ed Helms as the doctor who is on call for you. Some interesting details about these people come through in the film, the filmmakers even focusing on how they act when confronted with sickness and pain. It's a very moving and",1
" My friend was on vacation for a month and asked me to look up a site on a show she was watching. ""How the hell can I find it? I've never seen anything like it."" I was horrified to see her bemoaning the lack of theater information, and she would have no idea what I was talking about. I was able to find a little information",1
" This film is a beautiful picture; however, there is a problem with the sound. The sound is very poor. I had to go through the entire film to realize that the sound actually sounded ""good"". I suspect that the sound even after all the adjustments were made was actually too good. The picture is good, though small compared to the film's two-hour running time",1
" A DOUBLE LIFE is a masterpiece. It is a masterpiece of cinematic art, a masterpiece of irony, a masterpiece of beauty. I have been watching it ever since I saw it at the Edinburgh Film Festival and have only just been able to watch it again after rewatching it again with the latest commentary track. It is a masterpiece of drama, of complexity, of humor",1

" I keep observing the impression of the film that many of my friends have about this. There is an almost religious atmosphere. This is a film about faith and spirituality, for the most part. The music is refreshing, and the humor is thought-provoking. Being in the water at Panama City was a revelation. The sound was very recorded while actually near the water, and",1
" Excellent Western, with a good cast. It's a nice change of pace from too-long and too-often-viewed westerns. ",1
" Although I enjoy (other) Shakespeare's work, I was under the impression that the Tragedy of Hamlet was about the same kind of thing as Hamlet's life, and that it had to be greatly debated how that played out. But the play does have one thing about it I've never heard anyone talk about before: the love affair between Hamlet and Op",1
" I first saw The Castle in Detroit in 1986 when the cast and crew were performing in it. I was there to see a film that was very, very, very good. I found it a rare and extraordinary film. It filled me with an extraordinary feeling of pride. I was so proud to be a part of this film. I have seen it over and over and over",1
" With George Cukor at the helm as director, Katherine Paterson steals the show in A DOUBLE LIFE, which is a heart-wrenching film. The film, which takes place in New York City during 1932, is about a young man who is faced with the choice of either committing murder or working in the law office. Even though he is a lawyer",1
" I also got the DVD. Once you've seen it, it's easy to understand why everyone is so excited. You begin at the beginning, and the film ends at the beginning. The reason it has been a popular choice for years is that it has a taste and atmosphere that is quite different from the ordinary movie you might expect to see. The story is much the same",1
 This is the rare movie that has been able to recapture the magic that was once the hallmark of The Phantom of the Opera. What I like best about this film is that it is a fun and entertaining vehicle that is deeper (and probably darker) than any of the terrible shows that have been put on in recent years. It is a true triumph. It is fun because,1

I remember watching it with my parents on our big day and",1
" I think the film is well worth your time. The true stupidity on the part of Robert Conrad fails to impress, but it is a good insight into his feelings and childrens' emotions.

" I know what you're thinking: ""I never liked Hamlet and I would hate this film."" Well, I was wrong. This is the best Hamlet movie that I've ever seen and I've seen a lot. I think it's two things: 1) that Hamlet was truly misunderstood. 2) that this new interpretation of Hamlet is better than the original",1
" I never doubted anything about this film, but I had never actually seen it. It was one of those films that I kept in my bedroom, never opened in the theater because the reviews were terrible. I quite liked the film from the beginning - it just had me flinching whenever it came on. But if you somehow heard the film at some point, you might give",1

It is a story about art and the craft of story telling, a story about the importance of the audience in a film, and a story about life",1
" This is so wonderful that I hardly have enough space to review it... but then... war is always great! <br /><br />I have to say that the story is just a pleasant one. It deals with the two characters' love of a certain magic flower, a plant with a strange magic that nobody can explain... It's a story about love, the heart",1
" I saw this movie for the first time with my mom and I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed. I have to say that I found absolutely no interest in the overall story. As a kid I used to watch a lot of films, and I always liked to see how the movie was made. So I thought that this movie would be just like that. However",1
" A DOUBLE Life stands out as one of the more original examples of contemporary screwball comedies, and is perhaps the most unique example of them all.<br /><br />This film is probably the outing by Mr Colman in his 'greatest role' which made him a household name internationally. But it's also the most hilarious film I have ever seen,",1
" A DOUBLE LIFE comes from the minds of Robert Altman and George Lucas. Showing three separate perspectives, the scenes in each are varied, and each has a different scene-setting. Director George Lucas has had a long and interesting career. To truly understand his work, however, you must know a bit about the man. Lucas and his brother were college friends.",1
" A DOUBLE LIFE increases to a high level of excitement with its third feature film - a remake of the classic computer animation short ""Lapdance"". As the first printings of this picture were sold first to the press and then to the performers, these prints were originally accompanied by the caption ""A classic computer art short, albeit with a few liberties taken by the",1
" When I was between the ages of eight and ten, we had a TV hooked up to a cable network that came in close to a week after every switch-off. My father had a third hand TV, and my brother, who was about five, picked up the service. I was sent through the lineup, and I liked it. In those days, one of the",1
" I actually really liked this movie. It's a fun movie and I think it's kinda funny. It's just really funny. I'd give it a 10 instead of a 9. I'm guessing that since it has one more scene in it, it's now part 1. ",1
" I think the prospect of the Return of the King is unlikely to be a fantastical, but a certain amount of post-modernist animation is likely to be viewed objectively. But you would be mistaken if you thought that ""The Lord of the Rings"" was a historical film. Yes, it's a story about a wizard's journey across Middle-earth, but it's",1
" Jane Campion's film is the first film I've seen by a director I've watched before. I'm not sure it's a great film by any stretch of the imagination, but it's a film that I'll watch again and again, and certainly will continue to rewatch. I have a soft spot for Jane Campion. I've seen the last of her movies",1
 I leave the room and meditate for a bit! ,1
" Up to now, I've been a big fan of the Jean-Paul Gautier cartoon characters; but the man himself, in ""Corbino"", is really, really funny. Also, if you have never seen this movie, do it. It's absolutely hilarious... ",1
" This is the first time I've seen a movie that is absolutely not commercial. The movie is a bit on the slow side, I thought, but the film is pretty strong and well thought out. It's not exactly a classic movie, but it's still good. The thing I enjoy the most about this movie is the portrayal of the main character, a small-town",1
" It's been a while since I've seen a movie I really enjoyed. Hence, I decided to go back and watch it. It was a bit disappointing. I liked it, I just didn't enjoy it as much as I had intended. The story was interesting and I thought it had potential. The acting was good, but I couldn't really feel for the characters,",1
" I love this movie. There are enough good movies in this genre to fill an anthology. The problem is that there are only two of them: The Lord of the Rings and D. W. Griffith's pre-Civil War epic The Birth of a Nation. Both of these are classics, which is great, but how can you compare them? You can't. What I",1
" I am a huge fan of the Frank Miller ""Sin City"" series, so I was very enamored when I read an article about the upcoming film. It was about the plot of the movie, but not just action and story... I was so happy I had the opportunity to watch it... I'm not sure the comic book movie could have matched it... I felt",1
 This is a movie that the young cast and young audience at the Sundance Film Festival enjoyed themselves like there was a hula hoop contest where only the finalists could win. The story is complex... something real and not so real. The characters their eccentricities... the plot line with the past history and the motivation the characters have... it's a very interesting movie. REVIEW,1
" I was left in good hands. I saw this movie last year, and it was over too soon. The ending is too predictable and therefore a disappointment. But... The movie was actually good. The twists of the story brought back some memories from the past. The humor was very subtle, and made me laugh. Wow, where have these comments come from... I'm just",1
" I was pleasantly surprised by The Devil Wears Prada. It's a good film and it's about a very good film. But I don't think I'd want to watch it the first time I see it. This movie, I think, is a bit too political to be a simple comedy. The story of the film is about a guy who's trying to become",1
 It's great! There's NOTHING bad about it. The movie is action packed. It's very well casted. The main character's 'face' is great. Don't get me wrong... it's a good movie. But there's nothing I would say about it that I wouldn't say about a good movie. If this is your first time seeing this,1
" Yes, I know I'm a horror buff and will have to re-watch this movie. I really enjoyed a lot of the installments of THE WICKED, including ""The Wasp"" (which I also know from a previous review) and now this. It has a lot to live up to. As a bonus, it looks a whole lot better than the original",1
" I thought I would never love a movie as much as I did with this movie. I actually cried at the end of it! To be honest, I was so hopeful for this movie that I couldn't believe the movie would actually turn out to be boring. The movie had many of the qualities I was looking for from a film such as a little optimism, a little humour",1
" Released in 1961, this was the first film ever released to the public by Walt Disney Productions. I can't recall now if it's still on the Disney Records catalog, but I do have to wonder if they stop distributing Disney's upcoming DVD release this year. I'll certainly be checking out that one in the near future. ",1
" I read that this movie lines up with the works of Edward Albee. In that sense, I can say that it also plays to those same strengths. It is inspired by a play and like Albee, it explores the arts and art-life in one. This movie is very good. ",1
" Sorry to say I'm not a big fan of Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight.' I've always felt that there were too many of the same cliched themes in the film, and it just didn't add up with my typical Batman perceptions. <br /><br />What I can say, however, is that this story could have been so much better. The",1
 This is the first of a trilogy of Spiderman films for me... (Which I watched over and over again... there goes the film series) It's got great humor and a very nice plotline... though I'm not sure if the ending is really satisfying. I'm getting older and I never had any hope for the series to continue. I'm glad that these aren,1
" This moviemaking show <br /> <br />seems to be based around animation.<br /> <br />Then again, animation is pretty ubiquitous nowadays. This show gives us a good whirl, and the whole crew is doing a great job. It's a fun ride, so I recommend this show.<br /> <br />EVERYTHING HERE IS",1
" Thank God for the internet, it gives a better understanding of this modern-day studio's true face than... well... hardly anybody. ",1
" A viewer might want to give the one section of Stanley Kubrick's Criterion DVD we're going to feature just for this little tidbit of trivia: Kubrick insisted that his director of photography, Paul Newman, be given credit for the film's title. Alice Faye buys a body and the body is possessed by a demon. The character of the protagonist, played by Faye",1
" I'm rarely disappointed in one of Nunnally Johnson's books, and this was no exception. It's a funny and comforting tale of a woman who loses her faith and is deeply affected by the realization. As reported in Little Black Lies, the movie itself is a film about a family that goes through a time of loss and loss of faith. It is told from the",1
" A little bit of the same old tricks that have always proven effective in mainstream Hollywood are back. But this time, the artists have gone for the ""modern"" and the ""hip"". The film opens with a girl, who is practically a kid in her own body, being drugged by her boyfriend. This is followed by an explosion that sends her body flying through the air",1
" It was nice to see the movies made in New Zealand that were not directed by either Lawrence Kasdan or Scott Cooper... This was one of those movies like The Great Escape - the Steven Spielberg vehicle, and it's the only Steven Spielberg movie that I've ever seen... the others have been crap... Anyway, the story seems to be all about how a group of occult cult",1
 I'm a big fan of the Goodchild Family actors. Their work with the DTA was fantastic. They were on top form in this animated short. ,1
" A spectacular spectacle is happening! All the love and laughter and all the feelings! Yes, my friends, it's reality TV.... but it's really something serious that we will have to see to believe.<br /><br />MOVIE REVIEWS FOR THE WEEKEND: August 2nd:<br /><br />""The Dark Knight""<br /",1
" A certain 'wacky' writer (perhaps a caricature?) and his wife are obviously in the midst of a downward spiral, and they have to make their divorced daughter, Sheila, feel guilty for having a crush on their son, Jack. ",1
" Another Disney movie you can expect to see a lot of repeats - but it's not bad, it's just a Disney movie. The only difference is that a lot of people rave about how much fun this is. ",1
 The movie was so good that I actually had to see it again the second time for the second week of March. I'm not entirely sure why I saw it in the cinemas on that day... I suppose it was just a little weird... Close to the end of the movie the sound of a voice suddenly cuts... I'm guessing it was Michael Jassem that was,1
" Like the previous review, it's the best Valentine's day movie I've seen in a long time. I'd really like to see this movie again... It's a movie for the year 2000, just enough to make you feel nostalgic but not too much CINEMATOGRAPHY: Robert Wolf, who worked on the Shaw Brothers comedies of the 1960s and",1
" This movie really caught my attention. It's low-budget but very well made with almost no violence and very little gore. It's got a nice political message with an interesting cast and a good movie... except for the fact that it's a remake of ""The Lord of the Rings"". And I'm not sure why I bothered to see it.<br /><br />",1
" Myself (and probably a very large number of other moviegoers) were looking forward to seeing the new directorial version of ""The Godfather."" A film based on the novel was kind of a natural fit, given Francis Ford Coppola's starring role in that film. The film, however, was poorly received and the cast was limited. It was the first of",1
" If ever a potential movie must've sounded like it wouldn't work based on reading the script on paper, it would be this one. Here we have what seemingly looks like a lurid and seedy soft-porn s&m flick, complete with the huge in-theatre poster, depicting a near-naked Christina Ricci chained to none other than Mr.",1
" I apologize for having to bring up this bad movie again, but, yeah... NO WAY is this movie good. Let me tell you the story of a guy named Kurt (Christopher Lloyd) who can't seem to find his way without his saxophone and guitar. This is his little experiment to find his sound. Now, I've seen one or two other movies like this",1
" This is a good movie. It's not that much better than the original, but it's a pretty good movie and it's also a good representation of the subject. I have to say, though, that I don't think it's a good representation of the subject. The characters are there, but they aren't the focus. ",1
" I don't know who this movie is directed by, but it isn't a bad one either. The story line is decent - there's a bit of comedy and a pretty decent story for the look of it. The costumes are aesthetically pleasing, and the evenness of the animation allows the characters to really move. I was very pleased with the story and content, the",1
" I was as stunned as all the other reviewers when I saw the trailer for this new animation by CLP Productions. I was super amazed by the simplistic and faithful presentation of a successful concept: a computer that can learn to think. So, I watched the movie and was able to appreciate its outstanding character development: Bill Nighlix as a hacker, Brent Ryder as the",1
" I have to admit that this film was more than a little over my head. With its surface level competence, it is a very fun movie to raise expectations on... and soon, it's wonderful. I've seen it several times, and I still enjoy it over and over again. It's a little too much like a cartoon for my tastes, but at least it's",1
" In the midst of mindless slog of recent cinema, this film brings a subtle yet definite flavor to it. It has me hooked from the beginning as it is incapable of being taken too seriously, either by the audience, or by the production, as the film is rather laidback and mellow in terms of its elements. It is refreshing to see a film not ""put together",1
