0," I saw this film when it first came out and have watched it again and again and again. In fact, when I got my first DVD player I bought it without question! There is something about this movie that is particularly appealing. It may be the story itself or the characters and the way both are portrayed. Or, could it be the music? All I can say is",1
1," This movie is definitely a case of ""don't judge a book by its cover,"" as I was expecting a typical dumb 1950's western, and instead was pleasantly surprised by a wonderful movie with great acting and a real heart. Sinatra's character has to grow up in the movie, and he does so wonderfully. It's hard to believe that this was the first movie he",1
2," I saw this movie on TV when I was a kid and I loved it. I've been a big Dean Martin fan ever since, but he really outdoes himself playing the abusive big brother with a chip on his shoulder. The ""starry night"" song is classic Sinatra and the fight scene in the bar is classic Martin. The climactic fight in the street between",1
3," I was able to see this movie many, many times the one and only time I worked at a movie theatre when I was a teenager. I fell in love with this film from then on. I now have it on DVD. I have not seen this film for many years so I decided to watch it again. It brought back many old memories. I especially loved the way",1
4," This was a very good western even though it's a little slow paced but what can you do, you still have to watch it. ",1
5," Also, about that final scene, when he's in jail, being told, ""You're a killer,"" and then he answers, ""Yes, I am,"" that IS a good line. It's an answer to a question that we've all asked ourselves: what if you really are a killer? We all fantasize about it once in a while, but do we",1
6," It's a shame Sinatra was at the end of his career and I've seen and heard him do better. Overall, the movie is fun, with the exception of Conrad's one-dimensional performance in a key role. Note the cameos by Woody Strode and Rosey Grier. ",1
7," see 'The Man From Laramie,' saying that Lee Marvin's character there is similar. But it's not. Sure, both movies involve a character who is framed for a crime he didn't commit, and both have some scenes in which the framed guy is wearing a ball and chain. But in 'Concho,' the framed guy didn't actually commit the crime --",1
8," I just spent an hour-and-a-half marathon watching this movie. I've always liked it from the first time I saw it on HBO. Along with ""The Magnificent Seven,"" it's one of my favorite westerns. Sinatra is really good. I'll give this movie a 9.5 out of 10. ",1
9," As a fan of westerns, and a collector of western films, I am always looking for that one ""new"" film that I have not seen before, and that will be a treat to watch. This movie is that treat! As a long time fan of both Frank Sinatra and Sterling Hayden, this movie is a real treat for me. I have not seen this",1
10," One of my favorite westerns. I watched it when I was a kid. Countless times. Still, do I watch it once in a while. ",1
11," If you like westerns with lots of action, you are going to be very disappointed. It actually has very little action in it. However, if you like westerns with a little more story than action, a little more character development, a little more psychology, then you are going to be very pleasantly surprised. Sinatra is excellent in the mellow leading role, and",1
12," A much underrated movie. The director is excellent, the story is good, the cinematography is good. The actors are great. A low-key, but highly entertaining movie. ",1
13, I saw this film in my youth at a drive-in when it first came out. I still remember the night and my car was smoking so had to open a window. The film is just as good today. An excellent western in which Frankie and James Cagney play the roles of brothers. The cast is excellent and the action is great. This film is a must,1
14, I was a teenager of about 12 when I first saw this movie on TV and have to admit that the title scared me. Somehow I had a picture of a vicious little dog in my mind. So I was surprised to see that it was actually a beautiful white stallion. And I was amazed to see that the horse was one of the main characters of the movie. And,1
15," The western is largely a tale of ""it is better to have loved and lost than not loved at all"". ""Concho"" is a truism of that tenet. Sinatra in an Oscar winning performance plays a young man who is in love with the wife of a vicious outlaw (Conrad). After killing her husband, Sinatra attempts to reach the woman he loves",1
16," On the surface, 'Concho' is a simple western, with an intriguing premise: Billy the Kid, who's been at his heels for the past decade, finally catches up to Ringo in a small Texas town where the sheriff is killed by an outlaw. (The town is so desperate for law that they don't even lock their doors.) The townspeople are",1
17," You can't beat a movie with a cast like this! What a cast! And George Sidney directed it too. It's a great story, well acted and produced. It's a shame that Dino never made a movie like this again. But, then again, he didn't make a movie like 'From Here to Eternity' again either. ",1
18," This movie is a bit dated in 1956 standards. It is has no sexual overtones what so ever. It is a western that has story, character development and a very strong plot with a wonderful twist at the end. When it comes to western film-making, this is a shining example of how to do a western the way it used to be done. The characters are",1
19," This movie is a great western. The main character, played by James Murray, is a young man who travels to the New Mexico territory to make a new start. The movie is about his personal struggle to build a cattle ranch, raise a family, and yet not compromise his integrity as he faces violence, death and political corruption. The movie is also about how James Murray's",1
20," I love this movie. It has a good story line, the actors are great, and plus it takes place in New Orleans which is my favorite city. I can really relate to this story line because I am a tomboy for the most part and I have a lot of guy friends. I'm not interested in getting married, kids, etc. This movie is one of",1
21," I was on Lifetime movie network and I saw this movie, The Wronged Man. I was very interested in the plot because I was like me, why hasn't anyone made a movie out of this? So I was very curious to know whether this would be a good movie or a bad movie. I normally don't watch Lifetime movie network because I don't like their movies",1
22, I have seen this movie and even though I kind of knew who the killer was from the beginning I still liked watching it. I would recommend it to other people. It comes on Lifetime movie network quite a lot. And I am thinking since it's close to Halloween they might play it more. So please be on the look out for it if you are interested in watching it,1

24," It's a decent movie. It's not exactly my cup of tea, but it wasn't a terrible film. There's no nudity, so for you fans of that you'll be disappointed. There's a car chase, which involves the characters in the film that's okay in my book, and there's a few unexpected deaths which is also a plus. I have to",1
25," This is a good family movie. I would recommend it. I believe that the whole family could sit down and watch this movie and it would be entertaining for each and everyone one of them. I do believe that the plot is predictable, but I am not going to say anything about that so you can figure it out for yourself. I do think the movie was a little to",1
26, The plot of this movie is very good. But the ending is what blew me away. It was so unexpected. I did not see it coming and I absolutely loved it. There is so many twists and turns in this film that you will not know what is going to happen next. The only thing I didn't like about this movie is that fact that they didn't give,1

28, This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It is really interesting to see how a woman can manipulate everyone around her just to get what she wants. Yep that's when I realized that she was the killer. But once you find out who the killer is. You will be shocked. It has a twist that I didn't see coming. And,1
29, I wish I would have known that this movie was going to be a real life story when I decided to watch it. I am a big fan of The Shield. Michael Chiklis (The Shield) has always been such a great actor. I didn't like his role in this movie as much as I liked his role in the Shield. But I do think that it,1
30, This movie is absolutely hilarious and I love it. I am not sure what I loved more about it; it's cast or the funny lines. Kevin Dillon is absolutely hilarious and does such a great job at showing you just how socially retarded he really is. Alicia Silverstone does a great job at playing a crazy ex girlfriend and her snarkiness really makes the movie. The,1
31, I will admit I was a little iffy on this movie when I first saw it. The opening scene with the scientist and the medical experiment that was going wrong. I was like what the heck was that about but as I continued to watch the movie it all fell into place. It was actually very interesting. The movie is based on a book by James Patterson. I have,1

33," This movie was very well done. I have to say that its a fairly new movie, but I really enjoyed it. I like watching Robin Tunney in a lot of roles, I think she is a really good actress. This movie did not have any big stars in it, but I think it was a good movie to watch, because it was a good storyline. Overall",1
34, I can't believe that this movie is finally coming out on DVD! It has been a long wait. This movie is so good and if you haven't seen it you should!

36, I love this movie. I am such a huge fan of Alicia Silverstone and Kevin Dillon. They did a great job as did the rest of the cast. I am so glad that they were able to bring this movie to the big screen. I am a huge fan of the original Stake Land and I think that the writers out did themselves with the sequel. I hope,1
37, I think that this is a movie that was worth watching. It's not up there in my favorites but it was good. It was a interesting movie. It was a good mystery and I loved watching it.

39, This is an awesome series. I couldn't wait to watch Episode 1. I just got done watching Episode 2 and I can't wait to watch Episode 3. I have always been a fan of The Sopranos so it was great to see Vincent Pastore playing his part on this series. You will see a lot of familiar faces from The Sopranos on this series,1
40," Although the film's beautiful, old-fashioned art direction, costumes, and photography make it look like a lavish period piece, it's not. The movie is set in present-day London, with anachronisms like fax machines and mobile phones. The spirit of the film, however, is unmistakably, and even thrillingly, 19th-century. I",1

44," This is a competent, if slightly dull, made-for-TV film that fails to explore the dramatic possibilities of its subject matter. The story is of the conflict in the 14th century between the Catholic Church and the supporters of the theory of the Earth's rotation. Some of the Church leaders were vehemently opposed to this theory. Typical of these was a Dominican friar,",1
45, `Pieces of April' is a portrait of an eccentric family and the daughter who doesn't fit it. The daughter is the best thing about the movie. The movie is a reminder of how good Kristin Scott Thomas was in 'The English Patient.' Thomas has a subtle style that captures a fuzzy warmth. ,1

226," A glorious film for anyone who loves Shakespeare. The cast is uniformly excellent, the cinematography is beautiful, and the story is very well told. Kenneth Branagh is brilliant in the title role, and you can understand why he chose to cast himself. The character of Hamlet is so complicated and Branagh does it so well. The ghost scenes are well done, and the",1

It is so brave and bold and weird, with unwarranted violence and strangeness that makes you feel like you are watching a David Lynch film on crack.

302," I got this movie on laserdisc. It is a great movie! Being a fan of the fantasy genre, I love ""The Lord of the Rings"". It is great animated film based on a book. It takes on a lighter side of the movie and it's pretty cool. Cate Blanchett is great as the voice of Galadriel. No, you won",1
303," Since the first time I saw the Lord of the Rings I thought I would be great, or at least good, as a cartoon movie. I'm not sure why, but for some reason I imagined a cartoon version to be easier to watch than a live action one. I can't really explain it. But when I saw the Bakshi version, I really didn't like",1
304," I’m not sure if people were aware of it, but there are quite a few similarities between the original “The Lord of the Rings” and “The Hobbit”. Some of these similarities include names, themes, plot points, and even the character voices of some of the characters. “The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey” does",1
305," I loved it when I was little. It's still my favorite cartoon. I like all the characters. I guess I'm just not very smart, but the writing is charming and clever. I don't think it's a movie for adults though. ",1
306, Wow... an animated movie that doesn't insult my intelligence... This was a great little fantasy movie... It restored my faith in animation... It has great voice acting... Some of the best I've ever heard... I mean... Ed Asner plays a sarcastic elf... Peter Falk as an owl... Annette Bening as a sexy sea troll... Plus... Alan Rickman as,1
307, A pretty good film making debut for Ralph Bakshi. Story is a bit anti-climactic but the animation is pretty good. The rotoscope technique is pretty good. The animation style is very traditional but that didn't bother me since it was still very well animated. The only gripe I had was that the story was a bit anticlimactic. The pacing of,1
308," If this is your favorite movie as a kid you are in for a treat. I got this movie for Christmas in 1989 and it is still one of my favorite movies from that year. It's bold, creative and funny. The characters are amazingly believable and there voice actors are just as good as the characters they are portraying. (In fact the actor who voiced Ralph is the",1
309," I've never seen the first three episodes of the Lord of the Rings so I didn't even know what to expect. I thought it was an interesting take on the book and it kept me interested all the way through. For those who are fans of the books, this is not a shot by shot reproduction. Nevertheless, they stayed true to the spirit of the story. I",1
310," For real, there is a difference between pros and cons. If you want to go into a movie theater excited about an awesome cartoon, you're going to be pretty disappointed with this movie. But if you want to see some pretty wickedly awesome animatronic puppets, well then, this is the movie for you. There are a few scenes that are slow, and",1
311," I'm only giving it this rating because it's worth a good laugh. The plot--that of a Hollywood director's attempt to steal the work of his rival--is interesting, but what made me laugh out loud was the expression of disgust that each time his assistant passed him a love letter she wrote for him from the woman he's trying to seduce (in the movie",1
312," A great film! It must have taken a lot of courage to make it, and it shows. The sets and costumes are so perfect, it could have been made 30 years ago! The animation is incredible, and the story is heartbreaking. All the characters are portrayed in a way that makes them seem real, even the ogres. There is also a bit of tongue and",1
313," For my money, this Conan adaptation is the best of the bunch. It does have a bit of camp here and there, but overall, I love its darkness. Oh yeah, and I much prefer the John Milius version to any of the Schwarzenegger ones. ",1
314," I saw this for the first time a few weeks ago. That's actually a lie. I saw the movie about 7 years ago at a friend's house and thought it was one of the coolest movies I'd ever seen. But I didn't know who Ralph Bakshi was and his name didn't ring a bell and so I never really thought about it again. Well,",1
315," [The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring] It's not perfect, it's a bit too long, the deus ex machina is a bit too over the top... but... damn... I'm watching the extended DVD version (which even includes a very interesting documentary with the people involved in the project)... and I'm thinking that, and I'm",1
316," This is a freakin' awesome anime! It's an anime/hentai/porn(?) hybrid. The animation is good for a porno and the sex is japanese hentai style, which is great! The story is interesting, the characters are great, and all and all, good stuff! ",1
317," I was so disappointed when I heard that James Horner, the composer of THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON, was not going to be composing the music for the film... So, I was happy to find out that. . . . . James Newton Howard's score was almost as good as Horner's. The score has a almost-ep",1
318, It's hard to describe this movie. It's like a dark comedy that goes into psychotic mind all the time. You need to have a very healthy mind to take it all in. ,1
319, I’m not sure how to review this film. It is a hidden gem. I saw this film when I was a kid. The film has a dark atmosphere for a kid’s fantasy film. It was my first introduction to the world of fantasy through the books. I found the film on cable one day when I was in college. I was surprised to,1

165," The movie starts off great with a bunch of stuff going on, but it slows down as you start getting to know the characters.

167," The worst movie I've seen in a long time . It looked quite good when I saw the trailer, and even the quality of the acting was decent, but there's no story or point to it at all.

It's not that the special effects are bad or the acting is not at a high level, but the idea is just so plain and any viewer with a little bit of imagination and a good memory will be able to predict what will happen next. The story is about a couple who moves to a new place",0

260," Who would have thought that a movie made by a rap producer would actually be one of the best films about growing up and lacking direction in the inner city? I can't remember if I've written this before, but I had to write a paper on this and doing research I came across a lot of criticism for this film, but the two main complaints seem to be that it",0
261," It has a great idea at the heart of it, but it just feels like it's lacking something. The directing is a little sloppy and it tries to do a lot with its story, but only succeeds in breaking its heart. The main problem lies in all the characters. There are too many to get to know, and it feels like the film is just trying to be",0
262," I'm a fan of Guy Maddin, and follow his work closely, having seen all his films. This is by far his best work, and I'm not just saying that because a lot of it is shot in Winnipeg, where I was born. The premise is pretty simple, but the complexity of the way its shot, acted, and scored by Carl Petersen is what",0
263," Almost as good as the first. It has the same great characters, more great music, and a lot more action and adventure. The films are really criminally underrated. ",0
264," Overall a pretty enjoyable martial arts movie with some good battles. Kinda mind numbing though and doesn't have a lot to say, or at least not in the way it presents its story. It starts out really interesting, but a lot of it is spent on establishing the main characters. Its very well done with the action, and the humor is really good, and Marc",0
265," This is my favorite film ever, so I hope you don't mind me putting it up. The very first time I saw it I wasn't expecting much because I was expecting it to be as great as the book, but I was surprised to find that it was even better. Coppola does a fantastic job at turning Puzo's book into film, and it",0
266," This film is downright amazing. It combines all the energy of Trainwreck, Amy Schumer, the humor/atrocity of The Farrelly Brothers, and the raw emotional power of William Forsythe, and it's all tied together with a pretty solid story. It's long and at times feels like it's dragging. The truth is, that actually works for it here",0
267," The acting is pretty good, though the plot is similar to many other films, this one doesn't really offer anything new. It doesn't really have anything special to offer either. Based on the way Robert Rodriguez works this is probably practically a home movie. According to his commentary it is, and it seems like he was just interested in making a movie that his kids would like",0
268," This is a pretty good movie, and one I really liked. It's pretty unique in its execution, it's not your typical feel good, rags to riches story, which is the main thing I wanted to say about it.

269," Terribly boring. It's a very average film, with bad acting and story. I don't recommend it at all. ",0
270," There is a part of the film where they show the stunt double for the actor who plays two characters (one being the main one, and the other being the stunt double) and he looks EXACTLY like the actor. I shouldn't be surprised. This movie is kinda similar to 'A Clockwork Orange' in that its violent and upsetting, but I felt it was more",0

272," Chuck Palahniuk adaptation, what more can be said? As a novel it was pretty decent, but I also have never read anything by Palahniuk, so I can't really say how to compare it. As a movie though, it still falls short for me. It does have its charm in some ways. The fight scenes were pretty well done, especially",0
273," There are two things to factor in when rating movies. 1. How much you liked it. 2. How good it was. The first is subjective, but the second is objective, but is that the right way to do it? I'd say yes. This film, like most, is only half good, but I loved it. It has some slow parts, but",0

275," This one is really bad, but I love it. I watched it because I saw it mentioned at least twice at the Kino website. I have a lot of respect for a film pastiche, and this film is one of the best. Every scene in this movie is taken from a different movie. The films are referenced on the commentary track on the DVD as well.",0
276," A decent film with great performances by the ensemble cast; David Morse, Mary-Louise Parker, Mos Def, John Heard, Macey Cruthird, Sheryl Lee, etc. The story is somewhat predictable, but this is the type of crime story that is supposed to be predictable and that's okay. I have a feeling that this is going to get a lot",0

Most of the time they don't get it right, unless it was a remake in the first place. This time, the story of the classic novel A Star is Born by William Wellman is given the Hollywood ""treatment"" and it's hard to think",0
279," This movie is the epitome of low brow, dumb fun. A big step up from the first two which were both very predictable, and this is still no masterpiece, but I do like that they went out and tried something different for this one. The action is just incredible; huge sets, great wire work, ridiculous stunts and car chases. There is one extended car",0

316, Uhhhhh no. what the hell? you get half way through about a character is what happens when u give a thousand monkeys a thousand typewriters and u get this movie.
