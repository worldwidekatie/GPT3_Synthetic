0," I have not read the book, but I have only seen the movie too many times to be sure which one I like better. Yet, some of the scenes seem so different that I was able to overlook the flaws and pass them by as I simply go with what the film tells me. This was a ""yes"" performance for me, which I don't mind because I",1
1," This is another film I've been watching for this reason: because of the music. The music in these films is so good that it's hard to believe that it is not well-known or well-loved. It's just a testament to that fact that this soundtrack is so enticing and memorable. The music here is vividly evocative, and it is hard to say",1
2,"

Richie manages to hit on the whole concept of this movie by taking his usual formula and hijacking it, where the best thing he has to offer is more of the same, and that is exactly what I'm talking about here. 'Conchos' is an amoral, S&M flick in which the main characters attempt to kill each other off,",1
3," One of the best movies I've ever seen. This gritty, satisfying revenge flick is just about perfect. I loved it, and I'm glad I saw it. It's a classic of the genre, and I hope to see it again in the future. ",1
4," Should we all be concerned? Should we rave? Is this movie possible? Is this movie on a par with films like 'Titanic' and 'The Devil in the Dark?' Yes, yes, I know this is the more thoughtful and thought provoking version of the already included 'Moonstruck,' ""But I don't think I am too much of a sentimentalist",1
5," Shia LaBeouf is a complex, complex man, and he hoover up, he hoover down one of cinema's most complex subjects, to find a way to convey it through his performances as two people who have lost their souls in the heat of a sexual encounter. The people who have lost their souls are both the people who lost their sex partners, the",1
6," I've never been very big on the movie sexy movies, preferring the more interesting, low-budget movies, but when I saw this one at my local, I ended up with a case of the '92 spasms, with a number of the stars being taken from the movie because none of the other stars were willing to do the scenes that had originally been scheduled for them",1
7," Okay, let's get this out of the way: this movie is a massive, yet not gigantic, failure. From the first second I'm captivated and in a tizzy about this film. I felt like I was a kid discovering a new cinema, and this film showed me the first time I saw it that it was a real film on celluloid, not a",1
8, The original version of this picture was rated R and was very much a victim of its time. The modifications to the way the material was shot and re-edited it resulted in a fairly brash but generally entertaining picture made for a crowd that already had its own version of 'Maverick' on par with 'Hustle & Flow' and 'Timecop.' It,1
9," Nothing like a good old fashioned all-out schlock flick to come along. And double bonus, for those of you out there that have been wanting to see this, it's available now on VHS, DVD and also on Blu-ray. Don't miss it. ",1
10," What's wrong with this movie? I'm pretty sure it was the name that gave it its title, but I don't like it. It's a fantasy, a self-destructive, and self-destructive fantasy. I mean, it's an evil, bad-girl fable. The problem with it is that it doesn't have a story. It tells",1
11," This is another fine example of the genre's continuing efforts to bring melodrama and sex to the screen. The film utilizes a formula that is brilliantly and skillfully executed in the words of director Darren Aronofsky, yet never loses its sense of purpose and integrity. The new cinematography, which looks like something straight out of something straight from the '80's,",1
12," Well, I really shouldn't say this. But I think I sorta-sorta do. I'm not going to mention the actors again, nor the film itself, just because I think they're probably quite old, or I'm not terribly interested in talking about it in this review. But the subject matter is too deeply loaded for that to be good in my opinion",1
13," Bootsy Collins is a ground-breaking musical. He's a fairly new concept turning out to be a hit with a lot of guys. But as of now, we have no advanced historical perspective on the man's life. The thing is about him. He's been a musician his whole life. He's a play-the-legend type, but that's really",1
14," This film was heavily promoted during the mid-50s, and it was released soon after the release of, of all films, Dr. Strangelove, a brilliant satire of the early days of mankind in its redemptive state. Well, so I guess that's saying something. This film was far from a masterpiece, it was merely one of the films released during",1
15," I picked up the book from the library and devoured it within two days. The biggest problem with the book was that: it was a novel. The film was a farce. It was an indisputably terrible film, but the book was a true and vivid tribute to one of cinema's most revered and respected directors, Ronald Neame. It was a tribute to",1
16," This movie was released in 1969, during the height of one-dimensional, farce movie-making. Johnny Carson, who in his later years was a prop, came from the Rolling Stones and got roasted by the Merv Griffin Show as ""Sexy"" Joe. It was the sound of his ears that inspired the artistic direction of writer and director Warner Oland to turn",1
17," The story of a man who succumbs to obsessive sexual attraction to another man's wife, while feeling disempowered by it, is one of the things that makes this film so great. The chemistry there between the two leads is so strong that your patience with each part of the story begins to wear thin, and the different time/space jumps that occur at the end of",1
18," I've been a fan of Robert Drew's (and his movies) since I was a kid, and it was the first film I ever saw him in. Well, I don't really remember having a time when I wasn't having nostalgia for this film or watching all of his movies with a smile on my face. Now that I'm 56, I can appreciate how he",1
19," It was always out of my league checking out the film when it first came on the big screen, but by the time I saw it, I was hooked. ",1
20, I loved this movie and I will never forget seeing it at the movies. There are so many people out there who can relate to the story and I agree with the sentiment that it's better to embrace the dark side than to let it consume you. I would give this a 4.75 out of 5 stars. ,1
21," This movie has more sadness and less humor than the previous two outings...I was hoping that the ""death"" element would somehow be more prevalent, but it seemed surprisingly under-utilized. But it's still a fun movie, even if it never does the score's plan to tie it down. My only problems are with the overly rushed death scene, which seemed like it",1
22," ""Conchos"" is an interesting and enjoyable drama that found its way onto the Lifetime TV network. Oscar-winner Sinatra (Silverstone) is this tough, smart town kid and Conrad (Conrad), the town's troubled but true son, is the tough, smart but rough leader. In the end, they are the ones that do all the dirty work,",1
23, I don't recall seeing this movie in the theaters but I found it at one of the smaller chain bookstores. I had a friend go looking for it. Maybe I was too hard on it. It was very enjoyable. I am into Patsy Cline music but I didn't see this movie with her. I think I liked it a little better with her. I,1
24," I enjoyed this movie. I saw it at a bar in Chicago when I was in college a few years ago and it was one of the first movies that I ever bought at a 'movies for kids' movie theater. It is an American tragedy, and it is a tragedy of great color, strength, and beauty. It is a film that bears its place in the",1
25," I was amazed at the sheer beauty of this movie: the stunning colors, the rich sepia tones, the deep color palette, the shimmering chiaroscuro. It had an almost ""wooden"" look to it, like a very rich and sophisticated fabric. It's like a dress with a few lace details, or a fuchsia dress with black stitches and",1
26," I haven't seen the suspenseful flick and was glad to see it finally on the small screen. I have been waiting three years for this and have been hoping it would be released. Well, now I know the answer. It is indeed suspenseful. The suspense is there all the way through the movie. The characters are well developed and intelligent. The setting is terrific and",1
27," I was very surprised to hear that this film is set to be released on DVD. Not because I didn't think it was a good film, but because I was never really a big fan of either 'High Noon' or 'Concerto.' I just didn't like the performances of the lead actors in either one of those films. I am glad that this film is",1
28," I'm interested to know how the critics feel about this. I believe that it's a wonderful film, and, as a result, I think that the sum of the two reviewers' opinions is that it is a great film! I don't think that there is any question that it is a great film. I'm always so interested in all different experiences and how the film",1
29," I saw this in theaters with only one other person. The movie started out okay but it mostly followed the example of its predecessor. There was a lot more comic relief, as the main characters' first encounter with an evil werewolf was to be a joke, but that was about the extent of it. I would have liked to see more in-depth character development, but",1
30," If you have never seen this movie, pick it up. It gives you a chilling feeling, a profound look into the changing world of 1950s Hollywood. This is a film that will shock you and you will feel for a while that it was done by a man whose life was made for this type of action; a man who is half machine and half actual person. The",1
31," I think this one is a classic. This movie didn't ""go to town,"" but had great characters, great characters, and they were all very good. It had a lot of humor, which is what you want in a movie. It was, for me at least, a good movie. It has been said that ""it's only a picture,"" but I think",1
32," I would love to see a new version of this movie. The parts of the movie that didn't work were the kinds of parts that have been done some times before (as I recall, William Wyler did a version of 'My Three Sons' in the sixties). I hoped that they would try to put their own spin on it, but apparently they haven't been",1
33," I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed seeing The Magnificent Seven and it took me a while to understand why that was the case. In the early 1960s, this is one movie that everyone should see. Even if you think that the movie is too long or too technical, and you're not into movies where there are black people killing off each other. It's a fun",1
34," I attended a gala held to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the ""High Noon"" franchise. I went along with my mother and her family, who have since passed away. After the first two days of the festivities, I was so excited to see what would be shown that I had to leave my mother's room and make a hasty exit before I got ""High",1
35," For me, this movie is a counterpoint to the movie adaptations of the summer of love, The Song of Bernadette. In the movie you go to Bernadette’s high school for the first time. You get to meet many of the characters in the movie, and have a feel for them. It's like going to see a mass school play.",1
36," I have seen this movie lately and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was. It was seemingly not what I wanted to see, but I didn't want to become agoraphobic to avoid being disappointed. It's a half-a-second kind of movie, and in that, it is superb.",1
37, I liked this movie a lot when I saw it in '56. People were shocked when they got home and heard of its crime scene. I did not understand the police's apparent ignorance of the victim's identity. I think I had the right to know the name of the victim. I think I also had the right to know the circumstances of his death. What I didn,1
38," I saw this movie on a special midnight showing that it was on that Saturday night on the television. I must say that I found it much more compelling the day after on the Saturday morning. This movie has a very strong opening, a two-minute ""The Great Escape,"" and is followed immediately by ""The Magnificent Seven"" (1941). A great start to the",1
39," I can't seem to help but be reminded of the times you had to watch a film so that you could actually understand it. It's one of those movies that's almost easier to recognize than to actually appreciate it. 'High Noon' was like that. While the movie itself was a great little story about a killer, I couldn't help but think that the way it",1
40," The first time I saw the movie I thought, ""What is this?"" I found myself flinching when the demon guard came out of the shadows to inform the characters that the door was locked, but that was a fun distraction. This will not be my last movie, but I will definitely be watching it and re-watching it many times. The brutal murder of a",1
41," I have not seen this movie. It's the sequel to the 2003 film ""Pulp Fiction."" There's a lot that's different about ""Pulp Fiction"" than the original, but this one is actually quite relevant. I had never even heard of the movie before seeing it. I was kind of surprised that it was a sequel to a film I so rarely see,",1
42," This was an awesome movie. It was a little long, but the story flowed well and I liked the characters. I wish I could of seen more of the characters. I would recommend this movie to everyone. It is good, very good. ",1
43," This movie is not that bad. I would say it is the type of movie where you would actually like it if you are a fan of the play. It seems like the dialogue is a bit monotone at times and there is some grammatical errors. But just the screener of the movie, because even though it's a bit dated, it plays fine on",1
44," It was released on DVD last week and I don't think I will ever be able to watch over again because I couldn't wait to see what the third installment in the series had in store. I think that it's probably a fair assessment, but if not, I'm going to have to put this down and see how I feel about it. ",1
45," I have re-watched this movie since it first aired on Sunday night, and I can say that this is a very good movie. I thought it had the same strong beginning and end as the original version; and although the movie was a little less violent and scarier, and a little less graphic, this movie is a very good example of how to do a good",1
46, There are a lot of nice actors in this movie. I guess it's just a matter of what's realistic for other actors. I like the fact that they played the movie with the right amount of energy. It was a nice movie. I really liked it. The only thing that could make it better would be a big budget and a good director. I don't think,1
47," I thought this was a new direction for the movie. There are parts of the movie that could have been done with other actors, but the overall performance by Alicia Silverstone was better than I had heard. She brings a kind of serenity and dignity to the role. ",1
48, I don't know if the movie and the movie are the same thing. I saw the first movie and I thought it was good. After that I had to see the second one. The movie is so similar in many ways. But the movie is better. I think the movie is more offensive to the Jewish people. It is more inflammatory and it's a more strongly written,1
49," This was a pretty good movie, especially since it was a little different than most of the recent films that have been released. I didn't find it as scary as I expected, but I did find it kind of confusing. I would recommend this movie to someone who is interested in watching a movie and wants to see a different type of story that most of the movies that have",1
50, Well I watched this movie and it was good. The plot is sort of on the surface it was just kind of tacked on. But the two main characters made it work. There is not too much I would change about the movie other than to say that I would like to see more front and center action shots (unless its the final scene where he is blowing up and,1
51," I went out to the movies and saw this movie and I thought it was okay. I know people like horror movies even though I am not a horror fan but I still think that this movie is okay. There was something about the character that I didn't like. I don't know if it's the fact that he's Jewish, I think it's the fact that he",1
52, I think we're still in the PG-13 phase for this film. The acting was perfect and this is a crime drama that is not too big and not too small. ,1
53," This was a good movie, but it was 3:30 in the afternoon on Monday. That's why it didn't play. ",1
54, This is the first of my movie comedies (not the last) that I watched while wearing my SNES. This is one of the best movies I have seen to date. The humor is just so good. And it's fun to watch as you watch the two characters banter back and forth about their lives. The movie is a lot of fun. It is also pretty,1
55," Patience, patience, patience. I spent the entire time I was watching this film on the first 20% of it. As I was watching it, I never got bored. It was truly an unforgettable experience of the beautiful poetry of Shakespeare's and was just so much fun to watch. It's easy to see why this film has been watched over and over by people of",1
56, I love this movie. It is absolutely hilarious. I can't believe that it was made in 1980. I can't even believe that it was filmed in the South. I was sitting in traffic and I just thought how evil and twisted and sad this movie is. I really wanted to like this movie. I really wanted to like it and it was a little scary too.,1
57, I really liked the movie it has a very nice message about the power of love. ,1
58, This is a fantastic movie. It is not a difficult movie. It is not hard to watch. The script is good. It uses a lot of humor in the storyline. It's action packed. I rate this a 5 star. Just be ready to laugh. I know that I was right about the more serious storyline of the movie. I am sure that the movie can,1
59," A big thank you to Tony Danza and his brand new film, 'The Night Before Christmas'. You can't help but wish that you were that Christmas season. I think this is not the movie you want to watch if you just want to watch the Jennifer Lawrence movie. In fact I think you want to watch 'The Night Before Christmas' because of the Jennifer Lawrence movie",1
60," I've seen a lot of movies of all kinds over the years, including the predictable can't-believe-this-now sequels to Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. It's fun to watch and funny to watch. And when you try to explain what Hitchhiker is to the many viewers who haven't seen a single movie, it seems bizarre. And there",1
61," I actually liked Bogus Logic. I liked how it showed the power of the human conscience. When a man is faced with an overwhelming urge to commit crimes, he can't help but question his own conscience. And as society becomes more aware of the ethical dilemma of taking up arms against an evil, he is forced to exercise even more control over his actions. But I don",1
62," It's bad enough to watch a movie and have it not go anywhere, but when the plot involves a couple of guys who seem at first to be a couple, it's even worse. But I have to admit that what I enjoyed about the movie was the spectacular technical proficiency of ALL of the actors . . . there's a reason they got the parts. Not only did",1

They were called the Cherry Blossoms, for their red hair. Marlene met",1
64," The Englishman, John Huston, stars as Richard III, and is a subtle and perfect performance. On the surface this is not a bad movie. The story of the tragic King Richard III is told from the point of view of the English peer who lost his throne at the hands of his unprincipled and self-widowed brother, John Henry, and has",1

The result is a bunch of sniveling losers who become desperate enough to try to kill each other in the sub",1
66," It's not every day that we see a movie about Jesus. But this movie is a good one from a well-known, well-regarded director. And the memorable, if somewhat underwhelming, performance by Michael Radford is one of the few reasons I'd recommend it to anyone. I'm not sure his casting (he's an actor and not a screenwriter",1
67," This is one of the better movies I've seen on Blu-Ray.. If you're looking for an intelligent and well-acted ""dripping with humor"" film that's fun to watch, then watch this. My only quibble is that it's not as good as the non-film-reeling and watching as I expected. But if you want a comedy that",1
68," A story of love, lust and the price of love that was lost, and with a great cast of leading actors, this film has a lot to offer. And it contains one of the most stunning performances I have ever seen in my life. The first time you see Ron Perlman as Lykabeo, the price you are paying for is not so much the size",1
69," It's rare to see a movie with an opportunity to have a talented actor in the lead role, and this is a rare example. Not that there's anything wrong with an attractive female lead who's clearly not a virgin. The actress is in fact a very good actress, and the movie had a little too much of that female ""quality"" to me. . . and",1
70," I don't know why it took so long for someone to get around to translating Shakespeare's play into modern English. It's not even an English classic. It's an English classic, and certainly Shakespeare's work was in the classical tradition so it's not surprising that the play is considered a classic. But for me, it's a tragicomedy and a love story that",1
71," This is a welcome film, not just because it's a good movie. It's a welcome movie because it's a good movie. The picture is good, the actors are good, and the music is good (at least that's what the soundtrack sounds like). I would have liked to have seen the music a little bit better, because this is a movie so far from",1
72," This a very short and fun film with a lot to do and a lot of fun. It's not a ghost story or a mystery, but rather just a good time. The snappy dialogue is fun for the chuckles, and the love scenes are better than most romance films. Also, the performances are good, and this is one of those times when the results are",1
73, I'll rank this as one of the most interesting films I've seen in a long time . . . if I ever saw one. How can you not be hooked by a man who steals the hearts and souls of two very fine actors? Their performances are simply amazing. Al Pacino is certainly the most realistic actor I've seen in a while. The scene when he steals,1

On a recent trip to the Near East, I decided to see The Kaga Incident at the site of the brutal Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The movie is simply terrific. The screenplay is great, and the action is all right, but the heart",1
75," Barbara Dickson did a nice job of conveying the sense that the movie was not only a war movie, but was also a prelude to the war. But it was not really clear how accurate some of the historical details were, especially with regard to the age of the Russian Revolution. There were several big-name actors who were in the movie, but they seemed more",1

This might be the earliest instance of an individual being denounced by a government that",1
77," Despite the fact that the film was screened for the first time last night, the movie-goer who showed up was a man. The movie is only 4 minutes long, but that's enough to act as a platform for this arrogant, cocky, pompous, and conceited little man. Must be one of those people who don't know what they are missing since",1
78," This was a most-similar movie to the one I saw at the Criterion Collection a few years ago. Other than some fun visual effects, and the occasionally inappropriate musical score, it was an enjoyable and oddly moving film. The movie was well-done and the performances by the actors were superb, even if they don't pull off the best performance in the movie. (",1
79," I'll admit to being pleasantly surprised by this film. After reading some reviews of the movie, one comes to the conclusion that it's a weak piece of junk.

81," The director of the movie is so good with action and with actors. The picture is filmed in a way that keeps you aware of things, yet is not so unrealistic that you are withheld in the narrative of the story.

83," They teach you how to love, it's simple, but it's something you can't teach. The story is simple and not too complicated. It will surely be presented properly in 2 or 3 movies.

86," The first half of the movie makes me cry because I can not take it anymore! The second half is my absolute favorite part of the movie. I received it on DVD, and I really like it a lot.

I appreciated the interesting concepts of the story and",1

I'm really glad that the movie's theme",1

120," This show had a lot of heart and it was a quick watch. I wont give the whole show away, but I'll say its the turn of the new girl on the block, in her first movie role. This show had a lot to offer, but not enough to get a PG-13 rating. ",1
121," This film is a wonderful, soulful haunting piece. I loved how they used the theme of the gun. I'd love to see it used on a larger scale because it's such a beautiful imagery.

It is a great moment as the sun is warm on their backs",1

The show has a great story to it, with a very dark theme. The drama is also well balanced. The show is better than I ever expected.<br /><br />It would be great to see",1
144," IMO, this show was the best. It was a fun, make-believe filled show that had a lack of storyline and had a very strong storyline. <br /><br />In the beginning of the show, you're introduced to the cast and the idea of two families.

152," I am really enjoying this show and I highly recommend it! Its a brilliantly put together show.

It's not a show that's entirely for kids and adults, because you really need to stay with it for the entire show. And that",1
153," Wow, what a great time to be spoiled. This show starts off with a movie shot and the supporting cast shows up, hooked up to a cool camera, to do a quiz show.

<br /><br />Next to the first, I have to say that I'm so looking forward to the second of the two episodes, The Man Who Broke The Bank (2002). The show is a biographical comedy, sort of, about the life of John LaBarbera, star of the new sitcom, ""The Man Who Laughs""",1
159," It's not a criticism of the show, but I think a show would be best suited to a secret audience, because like I said, it's not really much of an audience. If you love comedy, especially a comedy set at a high corporate structure, then this show shouldn't bother you. If you're looking for the works of John Ritter, then this show",1
160," Where The Wild Things Are deserves its place beside classic films like North by Northwest and Apocalypse Now as the best ever return of a classic film.

162," based on some early publicity, the title of this film is a bit of a mouthful but its certainly not a bad thing.

164, It happened to me and here's why. It could never happen in real life. It seems to be the most recognizable film I have ever seen. I think it is a masterpiece of modern cinema. The only thing I didn't like was that the love scenes were rather forced. It was like a kind of battle between the love of the two films the love of the film,1
165," A great film. At a time when films are more likely to be defensive than constructive, this film is a must see for every viewer! You'll find yourself telling your friends and family about it. It's a great watch and a very entertaining film. <br /><br />I've been to the Bob's fishing site about the first one and then i saw that",1

298, DOUBLE LIFE is a re-make of the 1974 film of the same name. James Coburn stars in the new version (the original was filmed in 1977). The film is a simple take on crime cinema. It's basically the same plot but you never really see it from a distance until the last 5 minutes - which is kind of funny. In the end you,1
299, A DOUBLE LIFE has developed a mystique among film fans for two reasons: the plot idea of an actor getting so wrapped up into a role (here Othello) as to pick up the great flaw of that character and put it into his life; and that this is the film that won Ronald Colman the Academy Award (as well as the Golden Globe),1

To put it simply - this is a cartoon.",1

I just wish the film had been a bit more exciting, as a script-writer who has been involved in many international comedy flicks does not often have the opportunity to do a script-writing job that is the fun of having. The plot is typical of a typical comedy flick, with the main character seeking",0

The story itself is little more than a bunch of fun, childish hijinks",0

He uses the same secret agent persona as the one of James",0
