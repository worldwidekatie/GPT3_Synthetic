" Let me just say that this movie is not funny at all, not even by accident! I cannot understand why anybody would give this film a positive review. I got an award from work for watching this movie, but that's all. I had to fast forward through most of the sex scene and at one point, I just had to put it down and walked away because I",1
" ""City of God"" has been a critical and audience favorite for years. I've just finally decided to watch it and people were right... it's an unforgettable, powerful, and challenging piece of cinema. It's a film about violence, desperation, and the sins of the past, but it's not a film for the faint of heart... Brace yourself... REVIEW",1
" HOW CAN ANYONE NOT LIKE THIS FILM!!?!?!?!?! It's got the best ending ever,and it's got a GREAT message. I'd recommend this film to anyone who's life is in need of an Adventure! ",1
" Where to begin? ""Requiem for a Dream"" is about the first movie I've seen that makes me think - ""Wow, now I know how movies are really made."" This is a movie with a message that should be taken to heart by every young person in the country. This is a movie that really leaves a mark. It was so intense that I saw it",1
" I recently had the opportunity to take my 15 year old daughter to see this movie on the big screen. She had read the book and I had read the book. The movie was very well done. It was fast paced, had lots of action, and it was never boring. I had read the book and had my doubts on how they would be able to take this book",1
" Honestly, this is a really good movie. As I often am, I was extremely wary when I found it on the shelf. I didin't think it would be any good, but I thought I'd give it a shot, given that Adam Sandler is the leading man. I couldn't have been happier. The movie is really cool. It's pretty much your",1
" When I first viewed ""Coming Of Age,"" I did not know what to think of it. I did not know whether parents would find it offensive or not. Now, several years later, I have a completely different view of ""Coming Of Age"" and it has become one of my favorite movies of all time. Most people will find it shocking and very offensive for a variety",1
" I have seen these two movies in cinema when I was a boy. Both were showing with a single ticket. I remember when I saw these two films in a double bill, I was very disappointed with ""Quatermass 2"" because I was expecting what I saw in ""Quatermass and the Pit"" but I found that sequel so boring. However, these two films",1
" An endearing, touching, and hilarious film portraying the life of a young man of humble beginnings coming into his own. While the songs are not as quotable as the ones from ""High of the Curves,"" ""Dumb & Dumber,"" and ""There's Something About Mary,"" they're still good. Even the stalker song is fun. This is an entertaining",1
" One of my most beloved films. I've seen this so many times that I could pick up on something I had missed before. I absolutely love everything about this movie. I bought the soundtrack two years ago and will take it with me on a fun trip someday, knowing the whole soundtrack by heart. It's got great acting, a great plot, and amazing characters. It",1
 A very moving movie... The story is good and fast moving... The acting is superb... A must see movie for all who love love stories. ,1
" There was a time when a movie like this would not have been made with a black lead. I believe that this movie was an important cultural event even though it was panned by the critics. It may be important for other reasons too, but this one is the biggie. ",1
" This was a good movie, but not very funny. I am a fan of broad-comedies, but this was too broad, too vulgar, too gross for me. I can say that I enjoyed parts of it, but I'd be hard pressed to recommend this movie to anyone. 2/5 ",1
" my girlfriend bought me this dvd. she thought it would be a great romantic movie. well man, let me tell ya something, you don't want to watch a movie like that with a female on your lap. that's right, if you've seen the movie, you know what i'm talkin' about. not only is the underwear scene one of the most",1
 What can I say? I know this movie from start to finish. It's hilarious. It's an strong link to my past and will change the way I view film in the future. Hypothetically speaking :) The down-fall? There's no Socrates Johnson! ,1
" This is the first time I've seen this film, since I bought the DVD last year. The main idea I got was that it was a neo-noir crime thriller, and that there was no romance between the two main protagonists (I had read the synopsis on Amazon). The idea of a romantic crime thriller was why I bought it. Now, I'm not saying",1
 I have been dabbling in making movies for about 10 years now. I started making short films with my friends while in college and have been at it ever since. I know how hard it can be to get your film out there for people to see because many of my own have not been completed due to lack of interest from others or the fact that I would never be able,1
" This movie is on the top of my list of favorites, it's like the scene where Skeets tells you how he got his suit, and who made it for him. It's in the comic book, it's in the movie, it's in the book and it's all good! ",1
" This is an intense film. The subject matter is very dark, and I found myself getting caught up in the characters, hoping that things would work out for them. That is how you know a movie is good...when you are really involved with it! The acting is superb. It's hard to imagine A-list actors doing a better job. I also like the """,1
 I saw the film as a teenager many years ago when it first came out and was blown away by it. I have seen it many times since and it just gets better. It includes so many great scenes that lodge themselves in your head forever. There are so many elements of this film that are amazing and I can not recommend it more highly. The opening fight sequence against the,1
" This is a very good movie. Kevin Bacon really does a great job in this movie. I did think it was a little slow though. When I say slow I don't mean boring, it was a drama, it just went real slow. I think Kevin Bacon should have won an award for this movie because he did such a phenomenal job. If you like Kevin Bacon you",1
" I have seen this movie three times and I love it. I love how the movie is a comedy and it has action and it is about people who are very close. It is about these three guys who are childhood friends that graduate from college and they get jobs and they all live together. The main characters are Adam Sandler (playing the part of Rob Schneider, David Sp",1
" This is a great history of animation!!!! It spans from the early days of animation to the present, with stops in between. Ralph Bakshi is a master of animation and it shows in this film. In the past I have been very critical of his work, but in this one he really outdid himself. The animation is a combination of 2-D and computer animation.",1
" This movie is fantastic! It has an excellent cast, the story is great, and it is very original. I love the movie. It is a heart-wrenching movie. It is emotional, but not corny. I think everyone should see this movie. There are a lot of things in this movie that can make you laugh, cry, or make you angry",1
" What a great movie. I had the pleasure of seeing this when I was a kid. I wonder why this movie is not one of the classics of all time. It is an enchanting tale of a fairy tale prince trying to find true love, and I'm sure many princes must have tried to copy this one. ",1
" This review is for the original black & white version. The color version (which is much easier and cheaper to make) was made later. It is also very good, though, and one of my favorite films. ",1
" My father took me to see this movie in the theater when he was in town for my brothers wedding. He got the tickets for us as a kind, but I so loved the movie that we actually went out and bought out own copy that week. I love it when he comes to visit because we spend time talking and laughing about the movie. I am going to buy it",1
" I remember watching this film, and being amazed at it. It is the best stop-motion movie I have ever seen. The puppets were so natural and lifelike. The story is an original, and I haven't seen anything like it, before or since. The movie was made in 1971, and the special effects are amazing. It was filmed at a time",1
" This movie has everything. It has the comedy, the action, the drama, and the characters you can relate to. I saw this movie in the movie theater and I loved it. I've seen this movie over 5 times and still love it. I love the actors and actresses in this movie. I wish they made a second one because it is a classic. REVIEW",1
" This was the best show ever, and it was canceled? No one could play Missy Devereaux like Patricia Clarkson. Lisa Edelstein was also great as Julie. I would have loved to see more of the relationship between Julie and C.J. Between them, they were the greatest. Zack Braff was good, but he could have been better. A lot",1
 One of the best films I have ever seen! Nic Cage is amazing in this role. It's one of those rare films that you can watch over again and appreciate different aspects of the movie. ,1
" This movie is really great. The only reason I am giving it such a bad rating is because of the ending. I am not going to discuss the ending, but when it was in the middle of the movie I was wishing it would never end. I'm not going to discuss it because that would be spoiler alert, but I will say that I was very disappointed by the",1
 Saw this movie last night and loved it. I think it was a great movie. It is a bit slow moving at first but by the end of the movie I was on the edge of my seat. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes to be well entertained. Sandra Bullock is at her best in this movie and I would love to see her in more,1
" This movie is super fun to watch. It's a great movie if your a die hard fan of the Farscape television series. I really enjoyed watching this film. The film doesn't follow the exact storyline of the TV series, but it's really exciting to watch. It takes place a couple of years after the events of the series and tells the story of how John",1
" *****SPOILERS**** I loved this movie, it was good fun, better than any of the Jason Bourne movies. I'm not comparing the two but this movie is great, not just because of Liam Neeson, but because of the whole Ben Affleck and Jon Voight thing that was going on, I don't want to give anything away but the",1
" I own this movie and think it's very good. It's quiet, nice and a little sad, but so is the book. I think the basic idea that people need to be reminded that life is not about ability or what you can do, but about what you do with what you have. I use this movie in my class when I teach values in the classroom.",1
 I have watched this movie many times. The first time I watched it was because of my mom and dad who are huge fans of this movie. I have watched it with them time and time again. The storyline is awesome and the characters are so very well written. The actors that they chose for the voice overs are not ones that you would believe would be in a fantasy movie,1
" I thought this movie was really good. It has a really cool plot with great special effects! I think Laur and Heidi looked really good together. I know a lot of people think that the acting is bad in this movie, but it's really not that bad. There are better examples of bad acting than this movie. I didn't really like the ending. I thought that",1
" This is one of my favorite movies, I've seen it a couple times already. It's got a great voice cast, including Gena Davis as Mavis, Eddie Murphy as Mushu, and of course, an 11-year old Drew Barrymore as Lilo. The story is very touching and heartwarming. If you don't cry at least once when the credits",1
" Just watched ""Blair Witch,"" and thought it was pretty cool--definitely creepy with a good soundtrack, and I look forward to part 2! ",1
" I've watched this movie numerous times. Its just plain, pure, 100% fun. I love the John Hughes feel to it, and I love the 80's vibe. I also love that it's set in and around Chicago, which I'm from, but this movie makes you feel like you're actually there. It's a great movie to watch if you need to",1
" This is a fascinating film. It takes a unique cinematic approach to the word ""documentary."" It shows you the events (such as the assassination of JFK) unfold from several viewpoints in a linear fashion, in real time, and in real places - as if you yourself were there. You feel the tension, fear, and chaos as you watch it all unfold. You also",1
" A thoroughly enjoyable film. Kevin Kline is superb as ever. He really ought to have won the oscar for this role. And I give mad respect to Paul Scofield for his role as a very convincing, almost ""benevolent"" SS General. I still believe that this would have been a better film (and won the oscar for best screenplay) had it",1
" I have watched it a few times now and I still enjoy it immensely. I think that Jessica Alba is an extremely good looking lady, and she does a really good job with this movie. If you like action, you should like this movie. If you like a good love story, you should like this movie. It's pretty much an action movie with a good love",1
 This is an excellent film about an ex-convict and his various experiences on the way to his revenge and freedom. ,1
 This is a sickening movie purveying the false belief that all men are the same and that all women are stupid. I'm not going to belabor the point. It's sickening. ,1
" Rarely has a film been more deserving of the over-used term ""cult classic."" it's a film that has been admiringly discussed, quoted from and endlessly parodied by those who were lucky enough to have known it. it's a film that's perfectly suited to the needs of critics and academics. it's a film that has never been copyrighted or shown on",1
" This movie is a fun choice for those who enjoy shows such as Everybody Loves Raymond or King of Queens. However, I may be alone in thinking that the show does not hold up well on repeated viewings. The characters are all very likable, and the show has a quirky charm. However, the show is also quite predictable and the jokes are rather limited. Even",1
" It's the kind of movie you watch again and again. It is sad, funny, thrilling, and everything in between. The movie has a way of leaving you thinking about it long after you've seen it.<br /><br />What's not to love? The characters are great. The acting is great. There is a lot of scenery and editing, and a",1
" This is a wonderful film! It's a little slow at first because it takes a while to introduce all the characters, but you will be glad you didn't stop watching it before it gets to the good parts. The actual story takes place in the late 1800's (1898 to be exact), but can really be applied to today's world. Character development for the main",1
" The late Graham Kennedy (A.K.A. ""Gra Gra"" or ""Rampaging Redhead"") was an entertainer who had a major impact on Australian popular culture for more than five decades. He was a one-man entertainment industry, holding the world record for the longest running tenure in TV history, and propelling the careers of many Australian comedians, including",1
" My mom is a HUGE Humphrey Bogart fan. She has seen almost every movie he ever acted in. So, when I came across this movie, I knew that I had to get it. This is one of his best movies, in my opinion. He is hilarious in this movie! If you're a Humphrey Bogart fan, then you will want to get",1
" The following is a review of the films: ""Debt of Honour"" and ""Hear My Song.""<br /><br />I have seen ""Debt of Honour"" (1993)and ""Hear My Song"". The film ""Debt of Honour"" was not very good. I would not recommend it. The film ""Hear My Song"" is",1
" This may be the fastest I have ever seen a movie -- well, that wasn't quite the best movie of all time. But still, it's a shame that it's such a failure. I really wanted to like this one. ",1
" This is a very good movie. I think the best thing about this is the music. It's a great soundtrack with a bunch of great songs to listen to. Also, the performances are very good also. The story is pretty interesting. I think this is pretty realistic. I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, but I thought it turned out to be pretty",1
" Although I'm a big fan of the first two Matrix films, I have to admit that I wasn't really excited about the prospect of a third installment. As good as the first was, and as much as I loved the 2nd, the original Matrix was the only time I saw the Wachowski brothers at the top of their game. They lost me on the second",1
" Is it just me, or does anyone else find it ironic that the first - and so far only - three-hour epic film is based on a true story about a guy who made a movie about a war that was waged by a government that made a movie about a war that was waged by a government that was interested in making a movie about a war that was fought by",1
" The reason this movie worked is because of the acting. Jordan was great, but the rest of the cast, from the precocious little treasure that is Ellar to the great Andre Braugher, were all in top form. This is a good movie, and a good action flick, with a satisfying ending. ",1
" This is a first film, and thus unlikely to win any awards, but it is an inventive and engrossing little horror movie set in a remote region of Russia. I found it philosophical and even transcendent, which is fine, because it is about the end of the world. ",1
" A great suspense thriller (and I mean thriller as in the old sense of the word, not the modern sense of the word) with some of the best music/score that I have ever heard. What the movie does is take three different stories; murder mystery, political thriller and love story, and intertwine them beautifully. The thing that is great about the movie is that",1
" As a fan of the horror genre for a long time now, I have a relatively broad knowledge of the subject. For instance, I was introduced to the classic Universal monsters (Dracula, Frankenstein, et al.) in the late 80s and already knew about 30's horror films/horrorsploitation pictures (Dracula's Daughter, Island of Lost Souls",1
" Peter O'Toole is a fantastic actor. He has real talent, which comes through here. Jeremy Irons (I think) plays Biff in this movie, and he's quite good as well. The play is about two brothers (one older and one younger) and their father. (The older brother is played by Peter O'Toole.) The father dis",1
" I was surprised to find that this movie has mixed reviews. I found it highly entertaining and thought the actors were nearly perfect for the parts and the casting was a good choice. Jason Lee fit the role of the father, Ben Gannon, a man that is battling a struggle between good and evil. I like the fact that he didn't redeem himself just because he found out",1
" I didn't get to see this in the theatre, but I did get to see it last night. WOW. Plain and simple, this movie is incredible. There are no other words for it. While there are a few scenes here and there that are quite disturbing, the movie as a whole is really good, with the story having a beautiful message to it. It",1
" This is an amazing movie about a kid that wants to be a famous rock star. The actor that plays the lead, Lukas Haas is amazing. I watched this movie three times and I've never seen anything like it. It's not boring and it's not a musical. It's a beautiful tale of a boy who doesn't have a father and doesn't have a",1
" I received this movie in my Christmas stocking last year right before Christmas. I'm not a big fan of Christmas movies but I wanted to see it. If my mother thought I liked it, it probably wouldn't be coming out of my stocking anytime soon! I'll tell you why. I watched it the next day and again on Christmas day. It really is good. I",1
" This movie is very good because it has a very important meaning. It's about all the people who hide their true personalities. The actors and actresses were great! I would recommend this movie for anyone that hasn't seen it. I loved it! If they make a sequel, I'll go see it. ",1
" It was at this point that Macaulay Culkin was a star. I'm not a huge fan of his, but I think he's very good in this movie. I think this was a good movie, a pretty good story and cute to watch. I thought it was very cute, but it may not be everyone's cup of tea. It's a good movie",1
" I'm not one to go see the critics' darling, find a trailer for it and watch it on DVD. I don't care if it won all kinds of Oscars the year before, it's unlikely that I'm going to like it, because too much has been said about it. It's too hyped, and I'm probably going to be let down. I",1
" With the demise of the ""Fright Night"" franchise, there's been a gap in the market for vampires for a while now. Let's face it, vampires are cool, but there's something really missing from most modern takes on them. Something that the original film series had. That something is a sense of fun. A sense that these are truly evil characters but at",1
" I was excited to see that this film was finally made in the U.S. after watching the BBC show. The BBC version was one of the only to stay true to Doyle's novels and it was very well done. There were some changes in the movie and some liberties were taken with the story, but the writer and director did a nice job of keeping the spirit of",1
" I love this movie.I have watched it at least 10 times and each time I see something different,like a pop up book,you see new things every time.I like how they show some of the alternative realities.I like how they show that there is more than one version of a person.I have Taken away a lot from this movie-not to mention the",1

They meet a man (Mark Ruffalo), who comes from a religious cult. Emily is drawn to his wisdom and the love and support of the other members of",1
" I really enjoyed this movie. It is essentially an updated version of the classic comedy film ""Bachelor Father"". Eddie Murphy plays the role of the ""Bachelor Father"" in this film and is quite funny throughout the movie as he takes care of his niece during a time of crisis. In ""Bachelor Father"", the ""Bachelor Father"" was played by John Forsyth",1
" I can't say enough about this movie. I love the chemistry between Will and Julia. It's a wonderful, feel good movie! I'll watch it over and over again. I was a little dissappointed in the ending. After the build up, I expected a little more, but it was still a great ending after the surprise.I recommend this movie to all.",1
 I have been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD. I loved it when it was first out and I know that if it won't look any better on DVD. I really wanted to see the deleted scenes that was on the DVD. I really want to see the deleted scenes because in the deleted scenes it kind of explains what happened with the people that died and where,1
" One of my favorite movies of all time, I love this movie so much! I've actually bought this one on three different occasions, once on VHS, once on DVD and once on Blu-Ray. I love the actors in this one, especially Robin Williams. I love the music in it, I love the story, I love everything about it. I watched this",1
" This movie was just some comedy movie that was ok. I understand that it's based on a true story, but it's like you can tell. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, but I don't think it's a well-made movie either. It's a movie you can watch with your family, so it wasn't all bad, but don't",1
 . I think that the crowd at the premiere loved the movie. The theater was completely full. It was great seeing the fans of old cinema come out to support this movie. It was nice to see the many different types of people that were in attendance. The only negative thing that I can say about the screening was that the print of the movie they showed was not in the,1
 The first half of this movie was so incredibly corny. The scenes of the two main characters in bed just talking to each other and falling in love was not good. I kept waiting for it to improve. It did not.<br /><br />The second half was a little better. There was some action and it finally seemed like the movie was going somewhere. The,1
" I saw this movie in a film class in college, and it is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLY TERRIBLY TERRIBLE. I could even make up some puns so you can get the full impression of how terrible this movie really is. But I probably will get some kind of copyright violation, and in this economy, I'm trying to save my",1
" I do not see why this movie is not on my list of the top movies in America. I do not understand why there are not more people talking about this movie. I find it hard to believe that this movie has not yet been released on DVD. I hope someone will do something about this movie, and get this movie out on DVD, so that it will be more",1
" This film is a great example about how a movie will play out with a great director at the helm. Tarantino's style of directing is so cool and unique that it cannot go wrong. I have seen this movie at least 20 times and it seems like every time I see it I get something new out of it. He is a masterful writer and director, a true",1
" I'm sure there are many people out there that are over the age of 40 that remember when ""The Prisoner"" was first broadcasted. I was young and had no idea what the show was actually about. I remember watching it with my family and loving it. I was enthralled with the character of Number 6. He was like an angel that came down from",1
 i love this movie its all about how a family grows up together and how they overcome life. i think that the parents played a big part in this movie its all about learning to stand on your own 2 feet while the parents are at work. i love this movie!,1
 I've been a fan of Joan Cusack for a long time. I really like her work. I think she's very talented and very funny. She was the best part of Addams Family Values and one of the best parts of My Best Friends Wedding. I also think she's very hot. And her performance in this movie is probably her best ever. She's,1
" I am a huge fan of The Name of the Rose and I am a big fan of Sean Connery. This movie is a horrible delivery of a superb story. I don't know whether it was because of its production, or because of its release date, but the studio released this movie with nothing in it. It was missing a lot of the story. I have read",1

 Just saw this movie on tv and figured I would rent and watch it myself. This was the first time I have seen it but my husband had seen it in the theaters when it was released. He wasn't sure if it was any good or not and we decided to watch it tonight. He said he liked it and I must say I did as well. The acting was,1
 Movie is ok but not really scary. I saw the end coming about 20 min in. I was hoping that it would get better and that I would be wrong but it didn't. The acting was good. The movie is very predictable. It's just a straight up girlfriend gets kidnapped after a party and the boyfriend has to try and save her. The boyfriend is too stupid,1
" Out of all the movies I've seen in my life, this one is probably the best. I'm not a fan of the horror genre, but this was so good, I watched it through to the end. I highly recommend it, even if you're not a fan of horror. The storyline is so good, it kept my attention from beginning to end. I didn",1
" This movie is worth a watch. You can't deny the suspense that this movie holds. I went into this movie knowing it was going to be good, but I was still surprised. It had everything a movie needed to have. It had action, romance, and drama. I was glued to the tv the whole time. The only downside of the movie was the ending.",1
 This is a great movie starring Robert Duvall and Michael Caine that is very intense and really pulls you in. It centers around a reporter at a small-town newspaper who is about to be fired until he hits upon the idea of writing a story about a serial killer who has been terrorizing the town. The reporter begins to suspect that a respected figure in the community,1
" Maybe I am too young to see this movie. But it wasn't a very good movie. I didn't like it. I won't recommend it, but you can see it. It wasn't really funny. I have seen good movies on TBS or TNT. I just think it wasn't very good. ",1
" THIS IS A FANTASTIC MOVIE!!!! I started to watch it, and found myself glued to the screen. The fact that it was made in 1985 was also fantastic, b/c in today's time, a movie about 40 year old man and his teen daughter, a movie about growing up would never last very long. I have never heard of this movie, and",1
" Not a great film but every actor of this film did a professional job. I had no expectations going in to this film. I had no idea who David Keith was. He is way overrated in this. I have seen him in a few other films and never really liked him. This was okay, one of those films that you would forget about after you watch it.",1
 What a great movie! Excellently acted and directed. It is one of movies that I have never seen before. It was very funny and sad at the same time. I really recommend the movie to everyone. It is a movie that should be on the top of top movies lists! It is a movie about two people who go from being friends to lovers to falling apart,1
" This movie is extremely funny! There are just so many funny things in this movie. You really have to watch it to laugh, the actors are very good. This movie is also very well made. It is very interesting to watch and and I just loved it. I think that it's a good film for all ages because there are funny things for all ages. I was",1
 What a flawed film! ,1
 I think that the movie was really good. It had my attention the whole time. I thought that the actors did a great job. I think that it was interesting to see the actual murder of Christ. One thing that I noticed that was cool was that there were no special effects in the movie. They had real water that looked like blood. They had a donkey that looked,1
" Ok, I have to say that normally I hate the stereotypical Hollywood ending, where the male lead ends up with the female lead after the female lead has been misled by the male's best friend. But it works here. To be more specific, when the female lead ends up with the best friend instead of the male lead, and he turns out to be a total jerk.",1
" I read this book in one day - it is that good. And it is not a book for young children or people who are afraid of the dark or spiders. It is for people who like to imagine and dream. I was impressed with the author, who has a great imagination and knows how to create a world inside the reader's head. The setting is a great haunted",1
" There are too many horror movies that just don't stand out to me. There's something in this movie that makes it stand out from the rest.

I've seen more than a few of the movies with the same plot, but",1
" The movie starts out with a young boy jumping from a hay loft in a barn, after a scare from a hornet and a horse. From that point on, the movie is an emotional roller coaster ride.

" After reading all the other reviews I realize that most people had a totally different point of view than I did. I did not think this was a bad movie at all and I actually really liked it. I felt the plot was interesting and the twist on the ending was done well. And let's face it, the cops are just there to look good and give a reason for",1
" I didn't like this movie. I usually like Miley Cyrus, but I hated her in this movie. I wasn't a big fan of the music in this movie, and I thought that the acting was bad. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. The only good thing about this movie was Miley Cyrus' performance, and even that wasn't that good.",1
" I was very surprised this movie was only released in three cities, how sad is that. This movie is very good, it is made with the same dark comedy that is in The Office. I would see this movie again if it came out on DVD. I would recommend this movie to any Office fan, or to those who like dark comedies. ",1
 I was a big fan of the tv movie of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The movie was pretty good too. The script was well-written and this one of Joss Whedon's best screenplay. I would give this movie at least 3 out of 5 stars because of its action-comedy plot. The film was that it could had been as good if not better than the,1
" This is a film that I have seen many times and personally, I feel should have won Best Picture in 2005. The story is about two young sisters, one who becomes a nun, the other who leaves the order to marry. <br /><br />Susan Sarandon plays the part of the sister who leaves, while Amy Irving plays the nun. The story is about",1
" Like every year, this movie gets better and better. More things are added each time this movie airs on TLC. This movie really shows well that we all are our own worst enemy and that there really is no such thing as a coincidence. It's a good reminder and it really makes you stop and think about what you are doing. ",1
" "" The Umbrella "" is a movie that explores the complexity of relationships both with the characters and their environment. The world that the characters live in is one that is not one of beauty but one of ugliness, filth, and frustration. The characters are forced to live in this world because of a love they have for each other. They love each other so much",1
" Where the hell is the 3rd installment? I mean, come on! We all know that the third one will be the best by far. Its a murder ballad! I cant wait to see it! I loved the movie-didn't want it to end. I went to the soundtrack.Listen to all three parts in order and you will be hooked. The songs",1
" I watched this film the other day, and it was totally awesome. I thought the violence was amazing. I liked the way they used blood from the forensics. The bad thing is that the police dont really seem to care that much. Like they were not really trying to find the killer. And they did not really give any clues that the killer was a monster, even",1
" I have rented this movie several times, and watched it over and over again. I think it is a great movie. The actors all do a great job, and it is so much better than any other version of this story! If your into the whole Titanic story and great acting, watch this movie! ",1

I was hesitant at first, but I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the movie. It's a great love story and a great movie. I would recommend it to anyone who likes love stories. It's also a great movie for",1
" It's just as good as the first movie, maybe better. But someone who hasn't seen the first movie will still enjoy it. It's the same actors in this one. The only things that were different is that the bikers are all in prison. The beginning of the movie made me think that the bikers had won and that the law was keeping them locked up",1
 A great movie if you like movies with a lot of action. I did. It was kinda slow in the beginning and I was a little surprised at the direction the movie took but still it was a good movie. The main character of the movie kept his word and that's a good thing. I was brought to tears several times through out the movie and I liked that.,1
" If you could sum up East of Sunset in three words, what would they be?<br /><br />Thriller, mystery, and love.<br /><br />Actually it was a fairly good story.<br /><br />The first night I put it on, I was going to give up on it because it was so slow moving. The main",1
" While this movie is far from being the best of James Bond films, it is far from being the worst. This is partly because there was actually very little of the Bond character in the original script, so director Guy Hamilton could not make any basic mistakes. The script was so lacking in Bond that any director would have had his work cut out for him. There were a few",1
 This is a film I've seen several times but I'm not sure why because it's so depressing. The acting is great and the story is well told. It's set in modern time and the main characters are a divorced couple: a young woman and a man in his late 40's. She invites him to dinner to celebrate the opening of her gallery and the occasion brings,1
" You know, it was probably just bad luck that I bought this DVD so soon after purchasing ""The Big Lebowski."" It's still pretty funny, but some of the jokes are getting a bit old by now. I didn't like the movie when I saw it theatrically, but on DVD, I laughed a lot more. It's still not great comedy,",1
" Sounds like the usual boring Hollywood propaganda. Unlike other reviewers, I've never met or worked with David Carradine, but I have heard him interviewed by Bill Cooper on the shortwave radio, and I've seen him in several public appearances.

" ""Sordid Lives"" is a bit like a good flourless chocolate cake: the first slice is good; but the second? Well, the second one is just as good, but you've had too much chocolate, at least for the moment. The second slice brings a little niggling feeling of guilt, which the first slice doesn't. Likewise, the second",1
" This is a really great film. I think it was better than Three Kings, and I love George Clooney, but he didn't have THAT much talent in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. The film was great, and the acting of Ben Affleck was striking. I loved the movie from beginning to end. This isn't like Gone in 60 Seconds (which I didn't like",1
" This is a great movie.I don't think that anyone could have played all the characters to the perfection that they were played. They all looked great, especially Brad Pitt. The scenery was spectacular and the music was excellent. My favorite character was the live action character, the old man. I would give this movie 5 stars. ",1
 I saw this movie when it first came out and I was blown away. I had never seen anything like it. I thought it was one of the most exciting movies that I have ever seen! I saw this in the theaters when it came out and everytime I think about this movie (I thought this movie was so good that I bought the DVD) I get chills,1
 Let me start off by saying that this is the Fast and the Furious franchise's strongest entry to date. It's very well made and it is loaded with exciting and cinematic action scenes. The movie's plot is very well thought out. Dominic is on a quest to get his family back. He's out for revenge against anyone and everyone who got involved with his family. This,1
" This is the best movie ever made! The story is so powerful, emotional and moving. It will make you cry and laugh. It is very long though and it takes a while to get used to the old fashioned language. But it is definately worth the effort. Everyone should see it!<br /><br />The story is about an ill girl who is going",1
" I did not want to watch this movie . The trailers looked boring. But the movie had many good reviews and it got a good rating from Rotten Tomatoes and I decided to watch it anyway. I'm not disappointed. It is a very good movie and that's why I gave it a 10. I thought it was very well made and the story is touching, sad",1
" I love this movie. I bought the dvd on a whim, and loved it. The dvd is absolutely stunning - the best looking dvd I have ever seen. The film quality is superlative, and I appreciate the fact that they didn't use any artificial colouring on the film. The only drawback of the dvd is the lack of extra features.",1
" I can take it or leave it. I have seen all of the Naked Gun films along with this one. This is the best one of the series, although all of them, while funny, aren't the funniest comedies. Kudos are in order for all of the actors for doing all of the voices, especially Leslie Nielsen. He's a genious. How",1
" This is a good DVD. The film quality is very good, and the sound quality is very good. All of the features are pretty good as well. The only thing that I didn't like about the DVD is that there is no way to print out the lyrics to the songs (other than just writing them down). But it is a good DVD. I like the DVD",1
 This is by far the scariest movie I have ever seen and I am only 12. It is about a young man who was in a car crash with his family and had a near death experience. From that moment on he can see ghosts. When his family is getting ready to go out he sees a ghost in the mirror and then he sees that the ghost is following,1
" I have watched this movie over and over and still think it is the best western I have ever seen. It's not a typical western. It is more like a swashbuckler but set in the old west. It's got everything: romance, comedy, action, suspense and a very memorable theme song. It made an American icon out of John Wayne, made George",1
" This is a great movie, obviously, I love Bill Murray. I like his movies better when he don't have to try too hard and can be himself. I like movies with a hint of comedy, well this one is funny and I enjoyed it a lot. The scene with the phone ringing in the middle of the night and the father trying to make the kids go back",1
" A very nice movie. The pacing is perfect. It is not too short and not too long. I just finished watching the movie, and the ending was too abrupt. I would have loved to see a little more on what happened to the characters after they got married. It's still a wonderful movie. It would be nice to have the book as a companion piece. I",1
 I can only laugh at myself for waiting so long to watch this classic. I knew silly me that I would be in for a treat. I have seen a few other movies with this cast and they always make a good movie. This one is no different. Christopher Walken is a genius!<br /><br />Here is what I think about this movie. It,1
" This is a story about a young married couple living in the city and trying to make ends meet. They have a knack for money making schemes, but they can not make them work, and every time they try, they get themselves into more trouble. Finally they decide at the bottom of their financial barrel to try some traditional money making ventures, and find themselves saving a poor family",1
" I was surprised to find that there are no reviews for this movie, and I found it to be one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while. The cast is incredible, Elijah Wood (Frodo Baggins), Jason Biggs (Jim), Seth Rogen (Jay), and all the rest. There were so many laughs that I lost count. If",1
 This was a pretty good film. I felt like the editing was a bit disjointed at times. But it was good otherwise.The acting was surprisingly good. The tone of the film was a bit of a downer because it talks about a dead son. But the supporting characters more than made up for that. It was enjoyable while watching it. I would suggest this,1
" Comedy/Horror was not what I expected. Not a bad film, but not a great film either. It is a strange movie. It is a mix of comedy and horror. It is a film that should be watched once. I can't see myself watching this film over again. It is a good film for a rental, not for a purchase.<br /><",1
" I have to say, this was quite a breath of fresh air. It's a shame it got so little attention, because it really was a sweet film.<br /><br />It tells the story of a down on his luck handyman, who is trying to take care of his mentally ill mother who is being threatened with being put in a nursing home. He is",1
" I was really looking forward to seeing this film as i am a great fan of Franco Nero. I was bitterly disappointed by a series of amateurish performances, badly overdubbed, very poor dubbing, that made the film completely unwatchable. The actress playing Nancy is very pretty and sexy in real life and her attempt at speaking with a British accent is painful to listen",1
" I gave this set a 5 simply because I am a HUGE fan of Joan Crawford. This is a remake of a movie from a few years earlier. Joan plays a cabaret singer. She is all about herself, has no time for others, she's a pretty bad citizen. But, she's also the best singer in the club. And, she's a widow who",1
" The film is a good example of the perfect blend of story based elements and technical elements. The story is very tightly woven. The plot doesn't have dead ends or get tangled up. The film is also very well written, with good dialog. The writers and director have a good grasp of the visual nature of film, and they construct the film to make it as visual as",1
 This is a great flick about an honest and decent cop who is trying to get a drug dealer out of his town.

" This is a real good film to watch, I don't know why it's not better known or more popular. I watched it 3 times already and I liked it more each time.

" It is a rather sweet film as far as the romance is concerned, but it is not a tear jerker as many people have led me to believe it would be.<br /><br />It is funny but not as funny as Carry On films, and as I am a great fan of Norman Wisdom, I was hoping that the two would make a great pairing. They",1

Somewhere between ""fine"" and """,1
" I can't believe how often I've been missing the point through my failure to watch this movie. I loved it and cried for a while with it. I especially relish how the film casts the characters in roles that are completely opposite to their real personalities. The character of the sweet, devoted, and very much ""do-it-by-the- book"" wife",1
 I thought this was a nice movie and it showed more of the original story than the play did. It was interesting to see the different relationships between the characters than just the one between Jason and Medea. I loved how they showed how Medea had a brother that loved her and was very sad when she killed him. I guess we all have family members that we can be,1
" Unfortunately, the movie is not as good as the novel. The movie is too long, and some parts are not good.<br /><br />The movie has a lot of problems, but the most important one is the lack of plot. The movie has a long beginning and an ending, but the middle is so thin that I mostly remembered the beginning and the ending.",1
 I had a theory about the cause of the Greer Garson's death and it was confirmed in this film. The reason she died was because the script really needed a death to happen in order for the story to advance.

" I love this film! It's a great insight to the life of Quentin Tarantino. As a director, he knows how to tell a story and can take it in other directions when needed. ""Tripoli"" is a great film, you'll really get into it. You should check it out, it's well worth it! ",1
" I really enjoyed this movie. It was long and I thought it would run out of steam but it just kept going and going. It lacks a good story line but if you like action movies and cool effects, this movie will keep you entertained. If you can't stand Arnold, he is not in this movie much. The plot is simple: A group of astronauts are sent",1

" An excellent film. I recommend it to anyone, at all, interested in film-making, acting, history, just about everything. The way it is done is breathtaking. You literally see how it was done. That is what makes it a great film. It's a film about film-making told via film-making. I love it now, as I did when",1
" I liked the movie. I liked the ending. It was not an ending that you would expect for a movie of this nature. I do not consider the movie as a horror film. It is a drama with a side of horror. The movie will be enjoyed by those that like scary movies. On the other hand, those that are easily scared may not like the movie.",1
" This is a movie about a young person's search for his old man. This is quite a noble and brave attempt to explore the inner workings of the brain of an old man.

 And now for something completely different. This movie combines every cliche of Indian cinema and makes it into something else entirely.

This is an American film made in India with both,1

 This was one of the most finest reviews of the movie I have ever seen. Very honest and I totally agree with you. This movie is an absolute work of art. It is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and again and get more from each time you watch it. I was at the screening at the Toronto International Film Festival and I was sick,1

 I really really liked this movie . I was really into it . When the girl and the guy are fighting and she is drunk she starts to change and it is a really great film . I really enjoyed it and I think anyone who has kids should watch it . Its not a good role model for girls but it is a great film . I think girls and boys should watch it,1
" What a movie!! I gave this movie the highest rating possible!! It is such a tear jerker. It's about two people who try to keep a relationship going when one is on their death bed. ""Why are you crying?"" ""I'm crying because I'm so happy."" You will have to see it to understand this comment. I guarantee you will not be disappointed",1
" This film could very well be a new genre. Many of the characters are dead; many of them are undead. The plot and cinematography are amazing, but the movie itself is just so beautifully made.

 This is a great movie and it should have been released in its full version.

" This is a great '90's movie that follows the story of a young man that is expelled from the U.S. Army after assaulting a fellow soldier. He returns home to his family and meets an interesting figure from his past. The plot is interesting, and the acting is great. The cast includes: Sean Astin, Michael Ironside, and Neil Patrick Harris",1
 This movie was a waste of my time. It is horribly boring and repetitive. It starts out with a pretty good concept (at least I think it was a good concept) but then gets so boring that you wish for it to end. The plot is so repetitive and the characters so annoying that it is hard to sympathize or even care for them.<br /><br,1
" So many wonderful areas covered in this book. I love the stories about the various stars that have graced the stage, the movies, and the television programs. I have read several books by this author and there is something in this book I have never read before. I am very pleased I have chosen to read this book. I don't want to spoil a lot for the",1

" In the days of canned laughter, viewers sometimes got a laugh track that was really killing them. With four sketches by the Monty Python boys, ""The Ant, an Introduction"" is probably the only ""serious"" Python film. The film portrays the life cycle of an ant colony, such as the procedure when a virgin queen ant goes off to mate, her return to the",1
" This is one of the most visually stunning movies I have ever seen. From the very beginning when the young girl is riding her bicycle across the bridge, the picture looks like a painting come to life.<br /><br />The basic story involves a young girl who is lost in the woods. She falls from her bike and the next thing she knows she is in a room",1
" let me start by saying that this is one of those movies that you'll laugh so hard that you'll throw up (literally). However, let me also say that you will not understand this movie if you're not familiar with the old west or old films. I watched this movie with my family, and we were laughing our butts off.

It has a killer soundtrack; it has a terrific cast (including John Corbett, Ernie",1
" Not a great movie, but definitely worth watching. It's funny enough to make you smile, but not that funny. The only truly funny part was the scene where Julia Roberts' character turns into a money grubbing monster. She is being really cute and innocent, then all of a sudden she gets pissy and starts yelling and screaming about how she deserves this and that",1
" I love this movie. It is very sad, but very real. The thing I like about this movie is that it really makes you think about how you treat people. I'm not talking about people who are mean to you, but the people you know and love. It is very hard to understand that in real life, it is very easy to have your life taken away",1
" I think this show has a lot of positive things to say about Christianity. Many people think that all Christians are intolerant, judgmental and close-minded. This show makes those people think twice and realize that some Christians stand for peace, love and understanding. <br /><br />The characters in this show exhibit a sense of humor and care for the less fortunate.",1
" This is the second film by Wayne Kramer, the director of The Cooler, and is based on far less known source material. It is an engaging and funny film about two young guys in the south who commit a series of robberies that turn out to be a bit more difficult than they anticipated. In the process, they meet two women - one with no memory and one who",1
" I disagree with the other reviewer who basically said this is a film for only hard core fans. i am a massive fan of the series and i was really disappointed with the style of the film. i loved that it was mainly shot on location in england and france but for some reason they've tried to make it more of a movie than an episode, and it just",1
" This is a wonderful film about a woman returning to her homeland, Ireland, and the film documents her and her family's growth and maturing as they experience the life around them. This film was very well made and I enjoyed it from start to finish. The actors were true to their roles, and the characters were very believable. This is the type of film that you end",1
 I watched this film when it first came out in 1996 and it was one of the first true comedies that I had seen since the hey day of the late 70's and early 80's. I had been watching the occasional comedy over the last 10 years but nothing as outrageous as Naked Gun.<br /><br />This film is a parody of the 1970's TV series,1
" A wonderful film! I loved the way they included all the old 60s cars and styles and music and clothes. (I got to see it a few times while in production at the studios.) It was a great idea for a film and the actors seemed very close to the real thing. It's not perfect, but it is a must see, especially if you are a",1

After three long decades, the aging, still-unemployed Charlie hits the road with a morose band of misfits he befriends at a rundown desert motel. Among them are the bluntly honest, drug-addicted bartender played by Bruce Dern, Charlie's half-brother voiced by Paul Reiser, and",1

 I had high hopes for this movie and had high expectations. I was not disappointed. This was a very good film. The story was well told and the music was awsome. The guys singing in the band were very talented. The dancing was great. And the actors were very good. Sean Greer was very funny. The acting and singing and dancing was great. But,1
" A great and very entertaining spoof of the Alien movies. With a brilliant cast including Sigourney Weaver who is in top form. The film is a lot of fun and is well paced with some great humour. The film is very original and has some great ideas. The film also manages to add some new ideas to the Alien movies, while still maintaining it's original roots. The",1
 YES! A VILLAINOUS CHARACTER NOT A LIKABLE ONE!<br /><br />This is what we've been looking for in the James Bond series for decades. This is a guy who is as bad as they come. He is pure evil. He's the type of guy that makes you cringe and hope he gets what's coming to him,1
" I saw this film last night and it was funnier than I thought it would be. The film is basically about a man who falls in love with a sheep after he comes down with a strange illness that makes him attracted to animals. It has some darker humour in it, but is mainly for laughs. It's a really funny film with some really funny moments. I would",1
 I was very impressed with this DVD. The person who made this movie had alot of talent and imagination to think of a story like this. The movie is very well made and it by far is one of my favorites. The only point I do not like is that the movie is so hard to follow and sometimes I even forget that Iam watching a movie and I forget to,1
 I bought this DVD set because I own the VHS set and I remember how much I really enjoyed these movies. I think they are excellent and just as I remembered. I think the acting is wonderful and the absence of a love story is a good thing. I also think that it is a really nice idea to have the story of the life of one person and to show,1
" The Greatest Story Ever Told-was a joke years ago, but this is a gem of a biography. The story of Jesus Christ has only been told about 10 times in the history of cinema.

" This is a great movie! I love the music, the story line, and the message of this movie. It's wonderful and uplifting. Beyonce is so beautiful and talented, and Jennifer Hudson is also wonderful. Musically, the soundtrack is really nice because it has a contemporary mix of old and new. This movie is also kind of funny, and it leaves you",1
" This is an excellent sci-fi film with a great cast and some really good action. The premise of the Earth being killled by a massive solar flare is very believable. Everything is done on a tight budget, but the story is well told. I had the DVD for about a year and watched it three times. After seeing Armageddon, I had to watch this again.",1
" The Matrix makes special effects history, and it's not with the fight scenes, the eye-shaking camera work, or even the fantastic visuals of the ""world"" of the Matrix. It is the digital effects that make the ""bullet time"" sequence a marvel. This is the first time I've seen real actors shot in a special effects setting, after everything else",1
" I wish that every young person in the world should see this film. It has incredibly thought provoking and moving subject matter. It is, at the same time, also a wonderful film about a group of friends who are struggling to find their way in the world. I have seen it a dozen times and never get tired of it. It is a wonderful commentary on today's society",1
" Any film where the first line of dialogue is ""We're on the crapper again!"" is bound to be a fun ride. David Zucker (Airplane, Naked Gun) hits his stride with this parody of high school sex comedies, as Bartleby Gaines (Matthew Broderick) gets stuck as the only male in a girls' school in a small town",1
" The story of this movie is about a trucker who finds out that his brother is going to die. He then runs into a girl who takes him to the hospital. The next day he goes to say his goodbyes and finds out that his brother is getting better. This movie is about letting go and new beginnings, and that you can't get something back if its",1

" In 1965, the first big, gross, ""X"" rated movie of that period was released, ""The Shape Of Things To Come,"" by the famed producer, Roger Corman.

" I had the chance to see this film at the Director's Guild in Hollywood Wednesday night - and it was great! Everyone was laughing, but the laughs were not ""silly"" for the most part. It's the story of a small town in Texas where everything has to be on a certain schedule - and when things go according to plan, everything and everyone is happy.",1
" This is a great movie for young people and adults alike. The movie has a good plot and the characters are very well played. The cast was excellent. Ed Harris was great as the FBI agent, Milla Jovovich was at her best as the lead female character, and the rest of the cast was great, too. The chemistry between the two leads was great,",1
" A deep and funny comedy that will leave you thinking. From the director of ""The Naked Gun 2 1/2"", this is a deep comedy that will leave you thinking.

" When one considers the outstanding performances over the years by Kevin Costner, Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone, all three are in top form for this movie!

" This is a truly excellent book, and it is hard to say enough about it. It is truly a comprehensive guide, covering the essentials of photography and then some. Its scope is broad, and its true value is in its depth. This book is intended to be a hands-on, comprehensive guide, and it is. The books starts out with the basics with the fundamentals",1
" This film is masterfully done by a master director. For such a minimal subject, the director brings a huge amount of faith, and passion into the film. You will never see a love story more powerful than this one. It has its slow moments(like any love story), but the emotions that runs through the film is real. I don't agree with those who say",1
" As a film, I liked it.....and I hated it. The film has been made - it's perfect; no need to remake it. The film is a satire on our culture and our society. It's a comedy. Satire. Like a Monty Python movie. I was constantly thinking of ""The Life of Brian"" - and yet it's not really making",1
" Another inspiring, educational, and highly entertaining DVD from History Channel. I had seen the series in the past, but hadn't seen it in some time, and was really pleased to witness the up-dating, the additional footage, and the new interviews. The series still maintains its original fascination and interest, and fascinated me anew, with the details, the place of the Civil",1
" This is a film that has been on my ""to see"" list for a while now. I had read the original short story by Stephen King, it is in the ""Night Shift"" collection, and found it very disturbing. That is what had attracted me towards the film. As a part of my Horror Collection I liked that it was a film for the Horror Genre",1
" This is an average film with an excellent cast giving excellent performances. George Clooney's performance as a burnt-out US intelligence agent is much more interesting than the main plot. In his best role to date, he plays the world weary, burnt-out, cynical, and yet secretly idealistic intelligence agent with a great sense of the absurd. The villain is also excellent,",1
 THE HUNTERS is more than a horror film. It is an examination of the human condition with the dramatic tension of a crime drama. It is a film that can be enjoyed by the masses with its 'devil in the details' casting of sophisticated social interactions. It is a film that philosophers will watch again and again to examine the behavior of characters; the impact of,1
" One of the best films of 2004. This is a small movie that explores the process of grieving in a very practical, moving, and emotional way. The film begins by dealing with the death of a brother by a woman who feels that she could have done more for him while he was alive. The slow, somber tone of the film builds as an excellent supporting cast is",1
" In the mid 1970's, writer/director Bob Rafelson was riding the crest of a wave of success after the critical and commercial success of his films, The King of Marvin Gardens, Five Easy Pieces and The Last Picture Show. His next project was to be a film based on the short story by Lawrence Ferlinghetti, called The King of the Jews and it was to",1
" I've seen the 1961 version of this fine film. I've read the play by Mr. Albee. I've even seen a live stage production of this film before. I had no idea, though, that a cinematic masterpiece of this caliber could be so effectively photographed. Evoking the feel of a typical Edward Hopper painting, the stark, almost monochromatic",1
" This is a great looking movie that tells a compelling story. The pace is excellent and the dialogue is authentic to the period of time that the film is set in. The cast is great and the acting is really well done. The movie is a bit too long, but it is still a really great movie that I would recommend to anyone who wants to see a good movie.",1
" A few years ago, a friend of ours lent us his copy of ""Werckmeister Harmonies"", the acclaimed Liszt Ferenc film by Bela Tarr, asking that we watch it and see if we liked it. I was a little leery about this as I had heard so much about ""Werckmeister Harmonies"" and",1
 This is a real eye-opener for anyone interested in the future of the planet. It contains a wealth of information and provides a clear picture of where we are headed and how we got here. It is also a very absorbing documentary. It uses great graphics and sound effects to make its points and I found myself thinking about it for days after watching it. The subject matter,1
 This movie was absolutely amazing. I strongly recommend! ,1
" One of the finest films I've seen in years! It has everything.....great story, acting, cinematography.......and a wonderful dog!

A woman of great taste and",1
" This is an excellent film for students of film. It is a film that has a bizarre premise, but is presented in an intriguing manner. The acting is quite good. This film has been shown in classes at the USC school of film, and is very popular with the students. The use of sound, music, and editing are interesting and creative. I have given this film",1

" A very good film about friendships, successes and failures, love, and life. Almost a slice of life film about a group of friends and their various troubles. As a film, it is pretty good, but becomes too melodramatic in its second act. Overall, it is worth watching, and has some great acting performances. ",1
" Although this film was adapted from a novel, the result was so bad that I couldn't finish watching it. The premise was interesting and the cast was great but the film just didn't work. It was pointless and a waste of time. I recommend avoiding this film and reading the book instead. ",1
" The Mosquito Coast is a work of art. The author has a remarkable grasp of character depiction and development. For example, his depiction of the gradual understanding between Caroline and the missing son, and of the other events that they are both experiencing. I have no doubt that the author must have experienced such events or conversations in order to be able to portray them in a manner",1
" THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY is one of the few remaining great classics of the 60's and 70's.

The two are hunted by bad guy Lee",1
 I have mixed feelings about this film. The premise of an old man who is dying of a disease and decides to reunite his family was very touching. I enjoyed the musical score (nice touch of the harpsichord) and the cast was good. The problem with the film is that it is too contrived. The old man's character is too good to be,1
" THE CONTINENT will be a treat for those who like New Wave films, and especially those who like movies about movies.

The young man",1
" ROAD TO SALINA is an excellent documentary about the search for the lost city of gold and it's aftermath. It's a fascinating story of adventure, greed, murder, and hopefully, redemption. The film covers the adventures from the beginning of the story to its end. I highly recommend watching the special features about the film and it's making. The story is told with",1
" ""The Illusionist"" is an absolutely stunning visual feast. The artistry of this film is simply amazing. The story is quite good, the acting superb, and the costumes and sets are breath-taking. The story is very well documented in the trivia section on the DVD. The film is about an amazing magician named Eisenheim, who performs illusions for the royals of",1
" The first half hour of this film doesn't work. The leading lady, Julie Christie, is on the phone to a voice that is not there. Or is it? Her hair is up, then down. What the heck is going on?<br /><br />Once the main plot is set and the characters are in motion, the movie is well worth several view",1
" This is an outstanding ""sleeper"" movie from the 1980s. The plot is a bit confusing, but the film has a good premise, excellent acting, and is often very funny. This film would have been a top-ten hit if it had been marketed better. The film is about a man who was a successful 80's ad man, but in the 90's",1
" John Travolta delivers a good performance in this movie, which is based on a true story. The scenes of the high jinks of the 1980's drug trade and the ""everybody getting rich quick"" mentality of the times are nostalgic, but tasteless, when the problems caused by drug addiction and the violence associated with the business are addressed. The greatest fault of",1
" The film is a richly drawn, gently comic examination of the internecine feuds within the notoriously dysfunctional family, the Fitzgeralds, and the effect they have on the second generation, in particular Zelda, the daughter of F. Scott Fitzgerald (played with dark, knowing wit by Judith Ivey). It's a quirky, engaging movie, and a marvelous cast (with",1
" I'm not sure what it is about this film that stirs me up, but I've seen it three or four times now, and I feel the need to recommend it to others. I think it's the character of the blonde woman who goes from being a little bitchy to suddenly being completely transformed by her encounter with the stranger. I can't pinpoint what it is",1
" A brilliant film. A must see for anyone who enjoys pure cinema, no song and dance, no loud and constant music, no car chases, no effects, just a brilliant story telling and acting. Let's face it, this is the real deal, the film has been labelled a 'period piece' and that's exactly what it is. It's just real people",1

" There's a whole lot to like about HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES - the general atmosphere is darkly enjoyable, with just the right amount of wry humor, the makeup is impressive, the whole mood is disturbingly effective in its atmosphere, and the cast is first rate. However, the script is really the most astounding thing about this film. One of the things I",1
" A pleasant surprise. I've had this film for a long time but never got around to watching it. I was pleasantly surprised by it. As soon as it was over, I was tempted to watch it again! It's a simple film, but it's well written and acted. It's one of those films that you can watch over and over again. I highly recommend",1
" I have not seen the original, but I loved this film. Therefore, I will give it a 5 star rating. I was deeply moved by it. Once again, the director, Peter Weir, has made an excellent film. The acting was wonderful. A beautiful epic film. I will buy it when it comes out in DVD so I can watch it again. The music",1
" ""The Missing"" is a superbly directed film with a fine dramatic structure and a very moving performance by Cate Blanchett. It has many of the qualities that mark excellent film-making, and almost overcomes its flaws to become a great film. I see that the film-makers are just trying to tell a story, but I get the sense that they might",1
" I'm not sure if I should be disappointed or elated - it's silly... but I was hoping for something more than one of those goofy, extremely persistent practical jokes. Not that it's a bad movie - it isn't. It just doesn't hold a candle to the original. BERMAN HAUSBERG is funny, and I don't mean intentionally.",1
" This movie is a gem. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Some will say, ""it was weird."" I say, ""yes, it was supposed to be weird."" It was a horror movie. This movie is just different from the rest of the genre. It's not about a serial killer, or the forces of darkness or evil, or even the supernatural. It's about",1
" This is a most enjoyable little film that took me back to a time when everyone had a dream. Part of that dream was that you could be anything you wanted to be, and the public would embrace you. You could be handsome and rugged or pretty and feminine. It is a time that has passed, but thanks to movies like this and Broadway Danny Rose, we have the",1
" I thoroughly enjoyed the pacing, the characters and plot, the special effects, the cinematography. Just wanted to watch it again after having seen it at the theatre. A science fiction film with real people (not people in the background), and not the usual cliched cut-out characters, or just some stars that you have to make an effort to identify as a character",1
" I saw the German version, as I could only find it here, and I was so glad I did. While I have seen the Russian versions, and they are all equally powerful, the German version is more chilling. One of the best things about German cinema is that they like to make movies based on novels. With this movie, they have made what I believe is the",1
" This is not a great film, but it is a solid entry in the horror genre. A group of friends are stalked by a creature that has a semi-human face, a black body, and incredible strength. The film is held together by a great cast, especially the leading ladies. A couple of the scenes are extremely intense - like the sequence where Phil (Ben",1
" I first saw this film in a screening at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books this past April, was struck by its subtlety and beauty immediately, and have counted the days until the film hit the big screen. I finally got to see the film again in a full theatre, and was not disappointed. A stark and austere ""art film"" which should appeal to anyone",1
" This is a neglected film that deserves a second look. This film uses the standard ""true story"" approach to tell the tale of a man's love for his son. Not being familiar with the character of real life boxer Davey Moore, I was not aware of his story or his tragic death. It was interesting to see how this film tells the story in a way that",1
" This is one of those films that every once in a while makes me feel sooo very old. In its time this was probably considered an edgy film, but now it looks like a tired joke. A woman is hired to be a companion to an older rich woman. She seduces her boss's husband, a well-known politician. Meanwhile, the politician's wife",1
" I have never thought of myself as the least bit ""geeky"", I'm a math major for goodness sake, but this film is good enough to bridge the gaps of geek, non-geek, film lover, sports fan, heterosexual, homosexual, liberal, conservative, young, old, whatever. This film is like a beautiful painting. You have to look at",1
" This is one of those films that should really hold a spot near the top of the all-time list. It's been years since I've seen it, and while I remember the basic plot and conclusion, I had forgotten the character names. It's a fascinating film and I wish they did more movies like it. The premise is fascinating. It feels kind of like a",1
" I'd say this movie is for those that like a good slasher film. Ignore all the bad reviews. This one kept me on the edge of my seat. I was surprised how good it was, and reminded me of The Exorcist. It's not going to win any academy awards, but I can't wait for the sequel. I loved the whole plot,",1
" I have seen a lot of movies in my time. But this one, by far, is the most boring and most pointless film ever made. It's not an action pix or a suspense. The story is completely unbelievable. This movie has a zero rating in my book. I hated every minute of it and would never recommend it to anyone at all. The trailer for",1
" An absolute classic. I have always appreciated the work of Merchant Ivory films, with the notable exception of the fictional BLIND JUSTICE, for it was a poorly written and directed film. This is not the case with HOW AUTUMN LEFT THE PARK with the witty, insightful story and wonderful dialogue from Marcia Jones. This is the story of two New Yorkers - a dress",1
" I was unsure about this one, but I'm glad I was forced to watch it. It was very good. I have hated Tim Allen since his ""Home Improvement"" days. I love the fact that he's not 'perfect'. He thinks he's straight laced...but he really isn't. And his family is great. It's a movie for all ages. RE",1

Sillitoe was an artist and writer who has influenced some of the greatest writers of his generation especially the beat generation. The film is",1
" I really loved this film. It's non-conformist, it's original, it's unique, and it has a lot of heart. The ideas sprinkled in are powerful and memorable. I found myself quoting lines during the week after seeing this film. One of my favorite lines in the film is when they are showing the first rest stop on the bike tour. """,1

I especially love the two little kids in this movie. Of course, I also love the hero and heroine of the film. They're such",1
 I have to say that I liked this movie. I watched it today and it was a lot better than I thought it would be. It was just so funny and entertaining. I think that the humor was very good. The performance of Ben Stiller was very well done. I have to say that I liked him in the movie. He should do more dramas I think.,1
" This is a must see movie for anyone who has ever had to deal with so-called ""tough love"". It's very sad that movies like this don't get the hype that they so richly deserve. For some reason, movies with a deeper meaning aren't given a chance to succeed in Hollywood. ""Buried"" is one of those movies. I absolutely loved",1
" I have just watched Kurosawa's Ran, and I am left stunned and awed. I have seen a lot of movies, and have read a fair bit of Shakespeare, but Ran brings Shakespeare's King Lear to life in ways I never imagined. It is a stellar achievement in filmmaking in every respect. It does not fit into any genre and is on the same level",1
" This movie is a masterpiece. It has all the consepts of the original, while also being completely original. I have not seen a film before with better special effects. The soundtrack is also good. The orginal movie was a comedy, but this is not at all. Its a very realistic and interesting film. If you are looking for a classic comedy, look",1
" This movie is a very good example of what happens when a movie studio snatches a hot property from another studio and tries to put its own stamp on the project. It has the great cast (Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn), the great art direction (Cannes is associated with a lot of the great sets in Hollywood movies) and a great selling-",1
" Let me start off by saying that I've never been a huge fan of Tarantino nor of the first two Kill Bills. In fact, I didn't even like them that much. I don't know what it is about Tarantino but I just don't think he's that good. My opinion of him was changed forever with the release of his latest film. The film",1
" An ingeniously inspiring film. When my friends and I rented this film, I thought it would be boring, but surprisingly, it turned out to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. The story is about a group of baseball players who, after they are discharged from the army, come together to play baseball for one last game. The acting was really good.",1
 I was very interested in seeing this film because I knew that there was something about the story that I didn't quite believe. I had read the book by John Grisham when I was in my teens and I was very curious about how this story would be told from the inside. I am glad to say that I was not disappointed! The truth is that I think that,1
" I am not a John Woo fan. I felt the recent ""Hard Target"" film, with Jean-Claude Van Damme as the implausible hero, was the most poorly-plotted, silliest, and undramatic ""action"" film (pardon the redundancy) I've even seen. My friend Ron was a big fan of the film, though,",1
" This was a fun movie to watch. It was a crazy, frantic adventure that had great action, drama, and humor. It was funny to see the sorcerer's apprentice as a child. The story was original, it wasn't a re-make of the first. The animation was great. It was very entertaining, and you would have to be a real Scrooge",1
" I have just seen the worst movie I have ever seen. I did not enjoy the film at all, yet found myself drawn into it. After watching the first 15 minutes, I was truly disgusted by the fact that I had wasted my money and my time. I thought, 'Who is this idiot that made this film? He should be fired! Using crappy effects, horrible",1
" A great film, great actors, great story, great effects. I think this is one of those films that you have to see at least 2 or 3 times before you begin to appreciate the layers it has as film. I saw it with a friend the first time, and it was a nice film. We didn't go back to see it again. Then, about a",1
" When you see the poster for this movie, you might think you are in for formulaic courtroom drama. The title, THE VERDICT, is pretty generic, and the subject, a possibly guilty doctor facing malpractice charges, seems like a sure-fire setup for a triumph for the little guy. And, while there is certainly an interesting twist on the usual courtroom movie",1
" A brilliant and fascinating film that understatedly makes a huge impact on you in more ways that one. The characters, the dialogue, the acting and the direction are all superb. The feeling of being inside the character of the story is there throughout and you get to intimately know the characters. But it's the directing that stands out the most. It just doesn't feel like",1
" A few years ago I saw this film for the first time. I had never heard of it, and had no idea what to expect. For the first hour I almost walked out; I just didn't get it, it was the last thing I had expected. But the film drew me in, and the more it went on, the better it got. It is to",1
" The Cider House Rules is what Hollywood should be doing - making good stories. It is one of the few movies that I have seen recently that has a strong story line that is not a sequel or the next installment in a long running series. The movie's strength is in the script by Irving, the direction by Lasse Hallstrom and the cast. It is also one",1
" Who doesn't like science-fiction? Especially sci-fi space-adventure? This is a great film, and it's one of my favorite SF films of all time. This film is the only film that I've seen that involves a space-station set. It is set up brilliantly, and the space-station set is the one thing that really shines in the",1
" Am I the only one who noticed that the name of the title is spelled wrong? It takes a really twisted mind to write ""The Cell"" - just sayin' - and just to make sure you noticed, I'm putting it in bold blue for ya. I saw this film on a dvd rental and I can say, as a dad of a little girl,",1
" I just finished reading this book for the first time. Nowhere near as good as say a Hobbit or Lord of the Rings, but still a very good book. I read it because I am so hooked on the Hobbit that I knew I would like this book too. I was not disappointed. This book has a few problems with pacing and plot. The pacing is erratic and",1
" I have always been fascinated by our human need to create God in our own image. It is the anthropomorphic fallacy that our entire Bible was written in this way. I am not a scholar, but I think I have caught glimpses of God in nature: in a beautiful sunset, in the minute I spend with a loved one, in the unconditional love of a dog.",1
" Without a doubt, the best movie of the year. The parallel stories of the FBI and the Italians were great, and the script was perfect. I also loved that each character tells his or her own story. This is significant because it lets you know what each character thinks of himself or herself. This film was like a great mob tale where you knew you were watching the downfall",1
" I believe that, as a cinematic experience, DOGVILLE can be compared to a ballet. In this case, the ballet is choreographed on a considerable scale, telling a story about the way we live today, and the way we probably always lived (in that we have never been isolated from the needs of others and the act of giving and receiving aid, and a compassionate",1
" This has to be the most perfect movie ever made. I don't want to say too much about this film, so I'll just leave it to you all to watch. The acting is excellent and the story really makes you think. The twists in the movie keep you interested and the ending is very powerful. Even though this is a foreign film, you don't have to",1
" This is a great film for anyone with an interest in Australia's history. It charts the story of the Eureka Stockade in Ballarat, a mining town in the goldrush days. The film features a number of great Aussie actors that really bring this time period to life. Well worth a watch if your interested in Australia's past, it's pretty unbiased.",1
" A CLASSIC! I was lucky enough to see it several times when I was a kid. The first time I ever heard of it was in the mid-70's when it was shown on public television. My dad and I were the only ones home that evening, so we watched it. They actually did show it then, just not all that often, and I was",1
" I saw this movie a couple of years ago, it was on TV. I think it's very good, it could be a lot worse. I've seen so many movies like this one and they all suck. I've seen worse to. And they say that this movie is so bad, but when you spend years trying to find a movie in the same category, this",1
" Great movie with lots of meaningful messages. I really enjoyed the grandpa character, and how he would just roll with anything. A bit unlikely, but he was still a very likeable character. I loved the plot, and how their was an actual plot. Such a refreshing change. The only real problem with this movie was the lack of a real antagonist. The enemy is",1
" A well-made, very entertaining family film. The animation is excellent; the music, the various sound-effects, and the vocal talent are all top-notch. This is a very interesting story, full of humor, adventure, action, suspense, and very light romance. The whole film is based on the premise of ""life imitating art"", and, as",1
" This is the BEST of the series of Bond films, so far. And that's saying alot. Roger Moore is at his best. This time he's not fighting the usual overblown megalomaniac who wants to take over the world. Dario is a neurotic, tempermental, psychotic, mass murderer who's turned an undergound bunker into a torture",1
" I was a little late getting to this movie, but what a great movie. It's a case of the plot really being the star. Gela Mosadkina is bone chilling as the evil mother. I was scared for the whole movie, which is good. I don't want to see a movie and I'm not scared at all. This movie had a lot",1
" ""Death at a Funeral"" has some of the funniest moments of the year. The cast is priceless. While the subject of the movie is rather dark, it is also very funny and the characters are rich and complex. This is an hysterical comedy that does not rely on cheap gags and low humor. This is a movie for the whole family to enjoy. It",1
" The casting of the two main roles in this movie was inspired. The pairing of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau made for an almost unending stream of priceless humor. Matthau was able to bring the great variety of traits of the three friends to full, hilarious life, while Lemmon's exuberant energy kept Matthau from getting too over-the-top.<",1
 This movie is a great movie about a young man's search to find meaning in his life. He knows that something is missing and he tries to fill the emptiness with a variety of things including alcohol and drugs. He tries to fill the void with a new girlfriend but that doesn't work either.<br /><br />The story unfolds quietly but with a sense of urgency.,1
" A wonderful and emotional movie about family and a special child. I'm not going to get into details of the story (because I think it would take away from the enjoyment of watching it) but be careful, this is one of those movies that will make you cry. Charlie is a near perfect child. His parents are loving and dedicated to him. The movie has a wonderful",1
" The slickest of the all-star flings that came out in the early 90s with the likes of MORGAN FREEMAN and AL PACINO just about stealing the show, this is a fast, enjoyable and surprisingly funny remake of the 1978 classic. Director Martin Brest is right at home in this slick world -- he himself wrote the book on ""Beverly",1
 I got this movie because I am a fan of the show. It's fun to see some of the other characters from the show. The plot has plenty of action and the twist is pretty cool. I think it's a good way to spend a Saturday. If you like shows from the 70's I think you'll like this. ,1
" I have been a big fan of the original ""Clash of the Titans"" and was pretty disappointed that this remake didn't follow the same formula as the original. It seemed to be geared more for the younger generation and while I probably would have enjoyed it more if I was in the younger demographic, I still enjoyed this remake for what it was.<br /><br />",1
" I have a hard time deciding whether I like this film or not. It's a very hyperactive, frenzied film, with a bit of self-deprecation thrown in to make the funny parts funnier. It's a very, very funny movie, but it's also very, very mean. I like that. I like it when a film can be",1
" Some movies are great for different reason than others. After 70 minutes, you are able to figure out which one is great for what reason. I was completely sucked into this movie. I have found many movies recently that I thought I would like, but I come off the movie thinking I would not want to watch that again. I came off Lost in Translation saying I would watch",1
" Of the many screen adaptations of the legendary novel ""Cimarron"" (1929), this is my personal favorite. In fact, I think that this movie is so good that it could be considered a silent film - so little does the dialogue matter to the story. <br /><br />The plot of the film is like a series of still shots, not a",1
" THE PRODUCERS takes place in the early 1960s, when the Borscht Belt Catskill Mountain resorts and hotels were still booming. This musical comedy is based on the true story of Leo Bloom, a well-meaning, but petrified accountant, and Max Bialystock, a slightly slicked-back, blustery showman. But Bial",1
" Should I watch it again? Probably not. Will I buy it? You're kidding, right?<br /><br />I'll probably never get over the fact that the most basic function of a ""signature weapon"" in a genre movie -- that is, the weapon that is used over and over again as the character gets better and better at using it -- is",1
" I am one of the few people in my age group who actually likes this film, and I'm not sure why. Well, I'm sure why - I actually LIKE musicals. This one, though, is the type of musical that I like the best. (I'm not wild about the Busby Berkeley musicals, for example.) This one has a plot that",1
" I was born in the 80's, but I was still young when Tim Burton's ""Batman"" came out. But still I remember it enough to see how much it changed the world. There was no superhero movie quite like it before or since, which is why I hold it in such high esteem. It was everything a Batman fan could wish for, and I knew it",1
" I watched this film with a friend who had not seen it before. I have had it on DVD for many years and decided it was time it found a new home. We both loved it.<br /><br />Billy Bob Thornton plays a brilliant part as a man wanting to get into the music business. As a musician he is not very good, but as a song",1
" In the words of the immortal Dean Wormer: ""GREAT PARTY!!!!""<br /><br />This is a classic from beginning to end. I love the scene where the boys are going off to college, and Otis Day and his band are playing the theme song to ""Animal House"" much to the chagrin of the dean. I also love",1
" I can't help but feel that the most remarkable thing about this film is the fact that it's been almost 30 years since its first release and it's still being shown on television. It's clear that this film was made with the mere intention of entertaining since it's little more than a contrived comic-book look at the Robin Hood story, with Errol Flynn as",1
" The only way I can think to say this, is that I wish I could give this movie negative stars. That's how bad it was. This is the first movie I said halfway through that I wasn't going to finish it and actually *did* turn it off. It has a lame plot, bad acting, bad camera work, and the pacing is non-ex",1
" BLADE RUNNER is a film for the ages. It is a triumph of film making. Harrison Ford was brilliant. His performance was mesmerizing. Rutger Hauer was very believable as a futuristic threat to the human race. It's a movie that lingers in your mind long after you've viewed it. I was mesmerized from beginning to end, and it is",1
 Before i watched this movie I never heard of it and i was very surprised of the fact that i had never seen it. This is a very good movie and it is definately one of the best gangster movies ever. When i was watching the movie i was really intrested in the story and couldn't stop watching. Al Pacino is a really good actor and,1
" ""Uptown Saturday Night"" is a mixed bag of a film, with good points and bad points. The good points first: the musical score is very good. The ""What kind of a man would do that?"" scene is very funny. However, there is a list of problems that I had with the film: The script is weak in places, the bookends",1
" I think this is one of the best movies ever. This is a very complicated movie, and it is very well done. The movie has four main characters, and they all play very important and very unique parts in the movie. I think the acting in this movie is excellent, and there is a great cast. There are a lot of unique characters, and the movie shows",1
" The story of a scientist who comes up with a formula to make people invisible and then dies, leaving behind a fiance and a nosy friend. The fiance is played by Hedy Lamarr, and the friend is played by George Sanders, and there are a lot of surprises in this movie. The movie itself is entertaining as long as you keep one thing in mind; people",1

" The Chronicles of Riddick is a bad film. The question is, whether or not it is bad in an enjoyable manner. If you go in with a sharp sense of irony, you will find a lot to like here. The biggest laugh-out-loud moment for me was when I realized that the film was dumping on Star Wars. Fans of that film will",1
" My Best Friend's Wedding is the kind of movie that could have been better than it is, but there's enough here to make it worthwhile viewing for a fun night out. What's here? Well, there's a great cast of top-notch actors, and there's a great premise that's just fun to think about. There's the comedy, and the commentary",1

" My favorite work of Toei Animation's ""Magical Girl"" series, Majokko Daisakusen, or ""Magical Adventure"", was released by NuTech Digital in 2005.
