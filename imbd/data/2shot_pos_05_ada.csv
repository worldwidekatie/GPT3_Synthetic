" I have not read the book, but I have only seen the movie too many times to be sure which one I like better. Yet, some of the scenes seem so different that I was able to overlook the flaws and pass them by as I simply go with what the film tells me. This was a ""yes"" performance for me, which I don't mind because I",1
" This is another film I've been watching for this reason: because of the music. The music in these films is so good that it's hard to believe that it is not well-known or well-loved. It's just a testament to that fact that this soundtrack is so enticing and memorable. The music here is vividly evocative, and it is hard to say",1
"

Richie manages to hit on the whole concept of this movie by taking his usual formula and hijacking it, where the best thing he has to offer is more of the same, and that is exactly what I'm talking about here. 'Conchos' is an amoral, S&M flick in which the main characters attempt to kill each other off,",1
" One of the best movies I've ever seen. This gritty, satisfying revenge flick is just about perfect. I loved it, and I'm glad I saw it. It's a classic of the genre, and I hope to see it again in the future. ",1
" Should we all be concerned? Should we rave? Is this movie possible? Is this movie on a par with films like 'Titanic' and 'The Devil in the Dark?' Yes, yes, I know this is the more thoughtful and thought provoking version of the already included 'Moonstruck,' ""But I don't think I am too much of a sentimentalist",1
" Shia LaBeouf is a complex, complex man, and he hoover up, he hoover down one of cinema's most complex subjects, to find a way to convey it through his performances as two people who have lost their souls in the heat of a sexual encounter. The people who have lost their souls are both the people who lost their sex partners, the",1
" I've never been very big on the movie sexy movies, preferring the more interesting, low-budget movies, but when I saw this one at my local, I ended up with a case of the '92 spasms, with a number of the stars being taken from the movie because none of the other stars were willing to do the scenes that had originally been scheduled for them",1
" Okay, let's get this out of the way: this movie is a massive, yet not gigantic, failure. From the first second I'm captivated and in a tizzy about this film. I felt like I was a kid discovering a new cinema, and this film showed me the first time I saw it that it was a real film on celluloid, not a",1
 The original version of this picture was rated R and was very much a victim of its time. The modifications to the way the material was shot and re-edited it resulted in a fairly brash but generally entertaining picture made for a crowd that already had its own version of 'Maverick' on par with 'Hustle & Flow' and 'Timecop.' It,1
" Nothing like a good old fashioned all-out schlock flick to come along. And double bonus, for those of you out there that have been wanting to see this, it's available now on VHS, DVD and also on Blu-ray. Don't miss it. ",1
" What's wrong with this movie? I'm pretty sure it was the name that gave it its title, but I don't like it. It's a fantasy, a self-destructive, and self-destructive fantasy. I mean, it's an evil, bad-girl fable. The problem with it is that it doesn't have a story. It tells",1
" This is another fine example of the genre's continuing efforts to bring melodrama and sex to the screen. The film utilizes a formula that is brilliantly and skillfully executed in the words of director Darren Aronofsky, yet never loses its sense of purpose and integrity. The new cinematography, which looks like something straight out of something straight from the '80's,",1
" Well, I really shouldn't say this. But I think I sorta-sorta do. I'm not going to mention the actors again, nor the film itself, just because I think they're probably quite old, or I'm not terribly interested in talking about it in this review. But the subject matter is too deeply loaded for that to be good in my opinion",1
" Bootsy Collins is a ground-breaking musical. He's a fairly new concept turning out to be a hit with a lot of guys. But as of now, we have no advanced historical perspective on the man's life. The thing is about him. He's been a musician his whole life. He's a play-the-legend type, but that's really",1
" This film was heavily promoted during the mid-50s, and it was released soon after the release of, of all films, Dr. Strangelove, a brilliant satire of the early days of mankind in its redemptive state. Well, so I guess that's saying something. This film was far from a masterpiece, it was merely one of the films released during",1
" I picked up the book from the library and devoured it within two days. The biggest problem with the book was that: it was a novel. The film was a farce. It was an indisputably terrible film, but the book was a true and vivid tribute to one of cinema's most revered and respected directors, Ronald Neame. It was a tribute to",1
" This movie was released in 1969, during the height of one-dimensional, farce movie-making. Johnny Carson, who in his later years was a prop, came from the Rolling Stones and got roasted by the Merv Griffin Show as ""Sexy"" Joe. It was the sound of his ears that inspired the artistic direction of writer and director Warner Oland to turn",1
" The story of a man who succumbs to obsessive sexual attraction to another man's wife, while feeling disempowered by it, is one of the things that makes this film so great. The chemistry there between the two leads is so strong that your patience with each part of the story begins to wear thin, and the different time/space jumps that occur at the end of",1
" I've been a fan of Robert Drew's (and his movies) since I was a kid, and it was the first film I ever saw him in. Well, I don't really remember having a time when I wasn't having nostalgia for this film or watching all of his movies with a smile on my face. Now that I'm 56, I can appreciate how he",1
" It was always out of my league checking out the film when it first came on the big screen, but by the time I saw it, I was hooked. ",1
 I loved this movie and I will never forget seeing it at the movies. There are so many people out there who can relate to the story and I agree with the sentiment that it's better to embrace the dark side than to let it consume you. I would give this a 4.75 out of 5 stars. ,1
" This movie has more sadness and less humor than the previous two outings...I was hoping that the ""death"" element would somehow be more prevalent, but it seemed surprisingly under-utilized. But it's still a fun movie, even if it never does the score's plan to tie it down. My only problems are with the overly rushed death scene, which seemed like it",1
" ""Conchos"" is an interesting and enjoyable drama that found its way onto the Lifetime TV network. Oscar-winner Sinatra (Silverstone) is this tough, smart town kid and Conrad (Conrad), the town's troubled but true son, is the tough, smart but rough leader. In the end, they are the ones that do all the dirty work,",1
 I don't recall seeing this movie in the theaters but I found it at one of the smaller chain bookstores. I had a friend go looking for it. Maybe I was too hard on it. It was very enjoyable. I am into Patsy Cline music but I didn't see this movie with her. I think I liked it a little better with her. I,1
" I enjoyed this movie. I saw it at a bar in Chicago when I was in college a few years ago and it was one of the first movies that I ever bought at a 'movies for kids' movie theater. It is an American tragedy, and it is a tragedy of great color, strength, and beauty. It is a film that bears its place in the",1
" I was amazed at the sheer beauty of this movie: the stunning colors, the rich sepia tones, the deep color palette, the shimmering chiaroscuro. It had an almost ""wooden"" look to it, like a very rich and sophisticated fabric. It's like a dress with a few lace details, or a fuchsia dress with black stitches and",1
" I haven't seen the suspenseful flick and was glad to see it finally on the small screen. I have been waiting three years for this and have been hoping it would be released. Well, now I know the answer. It is indeed suspenseful. The suspense is there all the way through the movie. The characters are well developed and intelligent. The setting is terrific and",1
" I was very surprised to hear that this film is set to be released on DVD. Not because I didn't think it was a good film, but because I was never really a big fan of either 'High Noon' or 'Concerto.' I just didn't like the performances of the lead actors in either one of those films. I am glad that this film is",1
" I'm interested to know how the critics feel about this. I believe that it's a wonderful film, and, as a result, I think that the sum of the two reviewers' opinions is that it is a great film! I don't think that there is any question that it is a great film. I'm always so interested in all different experiences and how the film",1
" I saw this in theaters with only one other person. The movie started out okay but it mostly followed the example of its predecessor. There was a lot more comic relief, as the main characters' first encounter with an evil werewolf was to be a joke, but that was about the extent of it. I would have liked to see more in-depth character development, but",1
" If you have never seen this movie, pick it up. It gives you a chilling feeling, a profound look into the changing world of 1950s Hollywood. This is a film that will shock you and you will feel for a while that it was done by a man whose life was made for this type of action; a man who is half machine and half actual person. The",1
" I think this one is a classic. This movie didn't ""go to town,"" but had great characters, great characters, and they were all very good. It had a lot of humor, which is what you want in a movie. It was, for me at least, a good movie. It has been said that ""it's only a picture,"" but I think",1
" I would love to see a new version of this movie. The parts of the movie that didn't work were the kinds of parts that have been done some times before (as I recall, William Wyler did a version of 'My Three Sons' in the sixties). I hoped that they would try to put their own spin on it, but apparently they haven't been",1
" I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed seeing The Magnificent Seven and it took me a while to understand why that was the case. In the early 1960s, this is one movie that everyone should see. Even if you think that the movie is too long or too technical, and you're not into movies where there are black people killing off each other. It's a fun",1
" I attended a gala held to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the ""High Noon"" franchise. I went along with my mother and her family, who have since passed away. After the first two days of the festivities, I was so excited to see what would be shown that I had to leave my mother's room and make a hasty exit before I got ""High",1
" For me, this movie is a counterpoint to the movie adaptations of the summer of love, The Song of Bernadette. In the movie you go to Bernadette’s high school for the first time. You get to meet many of the characters in the movie, and have a feel for them. It's like going to see a mass school play.",1
" I have seen this movie lately and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was. It was seemingly not what I wanted to see, but I didn't want to become agoraphobic to avoid being disappointed. It's a half-a-second kind of movie, and in that, it is superb.",1
 I liked this movie a lot when I saw it in '56. People were shocked when they got home and heard of its crime scene. I did not understand the police's apparent ignorance of the victim's identity. I think I had the right to know the name of the victim. I think I also had the right to know the circumstances of his death. What I didn,1
" I saw this movie on a special midnight showing that it was on that Saturday night on the television. I must say that I found it much more compelling the day after on the Saturday morning. This movie has a very strong opening, a two-minute ""The Great Escape,"" and is followed immediately by ""The Magnificent Seven"" (1941). A great start to the",1
" I can't seem to help but be reminded of the times you had to watch a film so that you could actually understand it. It's one of those movies that's almost easier to recognize than to actually appreciate it. 'High Noon' was like that. While the movie itself was a great little story about a killer, I couldn't help but think that the way it",1
" The first time I saw the movie I thought, ""What is this?"" I found myself flinching when the demon guard came out of the shadows to inform the characters that the door was locked, but that was a fun distraction. This will not be my last movie, but I will definitely be watching it and re-watching it many times. The brutal murder of a",1
" I have not seen this movie. It's the sequel to the 2003 film ""Pulp Fiction."" There's a lot that's different about ""Pulp Fiction"" than the original, but this one is actually quite relevant. I had never even heard of the movie before seeing it. I was kind of surprised that it was a sequel to a film I so rarely see,",1
" This was an awesome movie. It was a little long, but the story flowed well and I liked the characters. I wish I could of seen more of the characters. I would recommend this movie to everyone. It is good, very good. ",1
" This movie is not that bad. I would say it is the type of movie where you would actually like it if you are a fan of the play. It seems like the dialogue is a bit monotone at times and there is some grammatical errors. But just the screener of the movie, because even though it's a bit dated, it plays fine on",1
" It was released on DVD last week and I don't think I will ever be able to watch over again because I couldn't wait to see what the third installment in the series had in store. I think that it's probably a fair assessment, but if not, I'm going to have to put this down and see how I feel about it. ",1
" I have re-watched this movie since it first aired on Sunday night, and I can say that this is a very good movie. I thought it had the same strong beginning and end as the original version; and although the movie was a little less violent and scarier, and a little less graphic, this movie is a very good example of how to do a good",1
 There are a lot of nice actors in this movie. I guess it's just a matter of what's realistic for other actors. I like the fact that they played the movie with the right amount of energy. It was a nice movie. I really liked it. The only thing that could make it better would be a big budget and a good director. I don't think,1
" I thought this was a new direction for the movie. There are parts of the movie that could have been done with other actors, but the overall performance by Alicia Silverstone was better than I had heard. She brings a kind of serenity and dignity to the role. ",1
 I don't know if the movie and the movie are the same thing. I saw the first movie and I thought it was good. After that I had to see the second one. The movie is so similar in many ways. But the movie is better. I think the movie is more offensive to the Jewish people. It is more inflammatory and it's a more strongly written,1
" This was a pretty good movie, especially since it was a little different than most of the recent films that have been released. I didn't find it as scary as I expected, but I did find it kind of confusing. I would recommend this movie to someone who is interested in watching a movie and wants to see a different type of story that most of the movies that have",1
 Well I watched this movie and it was good. The plot is sort of on the surface it was just kind of tacked on. But the two main characters made it work. There is not too much I would change about the movie other than to say that I would like to see more front and center action shots (unless its the final scene where he is blowing up and,1
" I went out to the movies and saw this movie and I thought it was okay. I know people like horror movies even though I am not a horror fan but I still think that this movie is okay. There was something about the character that I didn't like. I don't know if it's the fact that he's Jewish, I think it's the fact that he",1
 I think we're still in the PG-13 phase for this film. The acting was perfect and this is a crime drama that is not too big and not too small. ,1
" This was a good movie, but it was 3:30 in the afternoon on Monday. That's why it didn't play. ",1
 This is the first of my movie comedies (not the last) that I watched while wearing my SNES. This is one of the best movies I have seen to date. The humor is just so good. And it's fun to watch as you watch the two characters banter back and forth about their lives. The movie is a lot of fun. It is also pretty,1
" Patience, patience, patience. I spent the entire time I was watching this film on the first 20% of it. As I was watching it, I never got bored. It was truly an unforgettable experience of the beautiful poetry of Shakespeare's and was just so much fun to watch. It's easy to see why this film has been watched over and over by people of",1
 I love this movie. It is absolutely hilarious. I can't believe that it was made in 1980. I can't even believe that it was filmed in the South. I was sitting in traffic and I just thought how evil and twisted and sad this movie is. I really wanted to like this movie. I really wanted to like it and it was a little scary too.,1
 I really liked the movie it has a very nice message about the power of love. ,1
 This is a fantastic movie. It is not a difficult movie. It is not hard to watch. The script is good. It uses a lot of humor in the storyline. It's action packed. I rate this a 5 star. Just be ready to laugh. I know that I was right about the more serious storyline of the movie. I am sure that the movie can,1
" A big thank you to Tony Danza and his brand new film, 'The Night Before Christmas'. You can't help but wish that you were that Christmas season. I think this is not the movie you want to watch if you just want to watch the Jennifer Lawrence movie. In fact I think you want to watch 'The Night Before Christmas' because of the Jennifer Lawrence movie",1
" I've seen a lot of movies of all kinds over the years, including the predictable can't-believe-this-now sequels to Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. It's fun to watch and funny to watch. And when you try to explain what Hitchhiker is to the many viewers who haven't seen a single movie, it seems bizarre. And there",1
" I actually liked Bogus Logic. I liked how it showed the power of the human conscience. When a man is faced with an overwhelming urge to commit crimes, he can't help but question his own conscience. And as society becomes more aware of the ethical dilemma of taking up arms against an evil, he is forced to exercise even more control over his actions. But I don",1
" It's bad enough to watch a movie and have it not go anywhere, but when the plot involves a couple of guys who seem at first to be a couple, it's even worse. But I have to admit that what I enjoyed about the movie was the spectacular technical proficiency of ALL of the actors . . . there's a reason they got the parts. Not only did",1

They were called the Cherry Blossoms, for their red hair. Marlene met",1
" The Englishman, John Huston, stars as Richard III, and is a subtle and perfect performance. On the surface this is not a bad movie. The story of the tragic King Richard III is told from the point of view of the English peer who lost his throne at the hands of his unprincipled and self-widowed brother, John Henry, and has",1
" It was a good movie but it didn't live up to my expectations. A woman is bankrolled by her husband to engage in her husband's business - but various plans of his, including having her fired from her job, leave her in the lurch. The result is a bunch of sniveling losers who become desperate enough to try to kill each other in the sub",1
" It's not every day that we see a movie about Jesus. But this movie is a good one from a well-known, well-regarded director. And the memorable, if somewhat underwhelming, performance by Michael Radford is one of the few reasons I'd recommend it to anyone. I'm not sure his casting (he's an actor and not a screenwriter",1
" This is one of the better movies I've seen on Blu-Ray.. If you're looking for an intelligent and well-acted ""dripping with humor"" film that's fun to watch, then watch this. My only quibble is that it's not as good as the non-film-reeling and watching as I expected. But if you want a comedy that",1
" A story of love, lust and the price of love that was lost, and with a great cast of leading actors, this film has a lot to offer. And it contains one of the most stunning performances I have ever seen in my life. The first time you see Ron Perlman as Lykabeo, the price you are paying for is not so much the size",1
" It's rare to see a movie with an opportunity to have a talented actor in the lead role, and this is a rare example. Not that there's anything wrong with an attractive female lead who's clearly not a virgin. The actress is in fact a very good actress, and the movie had a little too much of that female ""quality"" to me. . . and",1
" I don't know why it took so long for someone to get around to translating Shakespeare's play into modern English. It's not even an English classic. It's an English classic, and certainly Shakespeare's work was in the classical tradition so it's not surprising that the play is considered a classic. But for me, it's a tragicomedy and a love story that",1
" This is a welcome film, not just because it's a good movie. It's a welcome movie because it's a good movie. The picture is good, the actors are good, and the music is good (at least that's what the soundtrack sounds like). I would have liked to have seen the music a little bit better, because this is a movie so far from",1
" This a very short and fun film with a lot to do and a lot of fun. It's not a ghost story or a mystery, but rather just a good time. The snappy dialogue is fun for the chuckles, and the love scenes are better than most romance films. Also, the performances are good, and this is one of those times when the results are",1
 I'll rank this as one of the most interesting films I've seen in a long time . . . if I ever saw one. How can you not be hooked by a man who steals the hearts and souls of two very fine actors? Their performances are simply amazing. Al Pacino is certainly the most realistic actor I've seen in a while. The scene when he steals,1
" I found no movie of better quality than this. It is just great.<br /><br />Trierweiler. On a recent trip to the Near East, I decided to see The Kaga Incident at the site of the brutal Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The movie is simply terrific. The screenplay is great, and the action is all right, but the heart",1
" Barbara Dickson did a nice job of conveying the sense that the movie was not only a war movie, but was also a prelude to the war. But it was not really clear how accurate some of the historical details were, especially with regard to the age of the Russian Revolution.

Anyone who thinks that homosexual behavior is a violation of his/her humanity should at least make sure they are surrounded by agents of terror. This might be the earliest instance of an individual being denounced by a government that",1
" Despite the fact that the film was screened for the first time last night, the movie-goer who showed up was a man. The movie is only 4 minutes long, but that's enough to act as a platform for this arrogant, cocky, pompous, and conceited little man. Must be one of those people who don't know what they are missing since",1
" This was a most-similar movie to the one I saw at the Criterion Collection a few years ago. Other than some fun visual effects, and the occasionally inappropriate musical score, it was an enjoyable and oddly moving film. The movie was well-done and the performances by the actors were superb, even if they don't pull off the best performance in the movie. (",1
" I'll admit to being pleasantly surprised by this film. After reading some reviews of the movie, one comes to the conclusion that it's a weak piece of junk. Most of the negative attention is directed at Louis Gossett, Jr., whose confused and inexplicable attempts to spice up his life by acting as a Depression-era saleslady and a pornographer have given the",1

" The director of the movie is so good with action and with actors. The picture is filmed in a way that keeps you aware of things, yet is not so unrealistic that you are withheld in the narrative of the story. The movie is very ""show your muscles"" and the actors have to display a fast-paced and fast-moving movement to the camera. The camera",1
" Just like my godaddy said, ""The story is not bad, but the characters are not good."" <br />I am not wealthy and have no children. The owner of a big boat is one of the most important characters in the movie, and in my opinion, he is not a bad guy or a bad guy at all. Everything, of course, is done",1
" They teach you how to love, it's simple, but it's something you can't teach. The story is simple and not too complicated. It will surely be presented properly in 2 or 3 movies. The actors are very good, everybody can act it's not only simply because they have good style, but also because they have personality and personality. ",1

I have never seen so many beautiful people being so magnificent in one movie. I'm a huge fan of director A.K. Ramis, but I have to admit that one of the",1
" The first half of the movie makes me cry because I can not take it anymore! The second half is my absolute favorite part of the movie. I received it on DVD, and I really like it a lot. I can imagine the scene, and you are taken aback by the suspenseful scenes. I am not overly sensitive to the symbolism, and I do understand oppression and",1
" All kinds of men who love the sea, all kinds of seafarers with rags and old people who love to be alive. It's not a straight comedy, but a real subject. Nothing is exaggerated or gross.

His life is threatened when some strange creatures suddenly appear in the island. He must fight his way back to the mainland and save his brother. I appreciated the interesting concepts of the story and",1

It's the story of a lonely man who lives alone. He's the only one he can trust, and he's not happy about it. He gets a connection with a very special",1
 I personally found the movie very interesting. I liked the idea of the movie. I liked the idea that that the country is in a state of transition. I liked the idea that the kind of people that people are sometimes think that they are a bad person. I liked the idea that the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo have a high level of education and have a,1

I'm really glad that the movie's theme",1

 This is a really funny movie and all the actors were great. Keanu Reeves as the true evil in this movie gave me a laugh to this movie. I liked the fact that there were no CGI effects in this movie. It was very good. ,1
" Best movie on acting I have ever seen. All the artists are old Turkish theater actors, they are magnificent in this movie. It is sometimes said that ""They do not act, they live it"", you can really see this in this movie. The director is also competent, you cannot see lots of moving cameras around but the positions of the cameras are also good. But after",1

" Excellent film, my pick, easy to watch. I think it is a bit pedestrian at the start, but it gets better and better. The director (Vincent Canby) is a great director, and he doesn't need to shoot it at all; it's his story, his vision, his allure. Martin Sheen, though not great, is a better actor",1

" This show had a lot of heart and it was a quick watch. I wont give the whole show away, but I'll say its the turn of the new girl on the block, in her first movie role. This show had a lot to offer, but not enough to get a PG-13 rating. ",1
" This film is a wonderful, soulful haunting piece. I loved how they used the theme of the gun. I'd love to see it used on a larger scale because it's such a beautiful imagery.

" This movie has some great scenes , and the one that I thought was the greatest was the shot in the kitchen, where Bridget and Kerry are laying in the sun with a glass of water, the shot is really the only way to get a totally happy ending, I can't blame the director for that . It is a great moment as the sun is warm on their backs",1
" In general, this is a good movie. The story was pretty good, but the acting really left a lot to be desired. Also there is a lot of violence too the post credits scenes, and there were some close ups, but other than that the movie was worth watching .

" Everything about this was shockingly horrible. It is a masterpiece of sh*t. From the beginning you are led through the horrible movie when you are first introduced to the characters. Then when they get the message, everything escalates into a crazy nightmare of a place with horrible people and everyone making you think that those people are your brothers and that you are no better than them.",1
" I really enjoyed these films, and am glad that I enjoyed them, and not only because of the strong cast of actors, but fast paced action scenes , and a very interesting storyline.

 The story is hard to tell. Well anyone who knows the story can tell you that. It is a story about an older couple. They are very messed up about the past and are described by their daughter as being very odd. They didn't seem to be loving very much right now.

It was a fun, make-believe filled show that had a lack of storyline and had a very strong storyline. <br /><br />In the beginning of the show, you're introduced to the cast and the idea of two families. The cast then changes to the main cast on a regular basis. The cast was",1

Its a highly funny show which can quickly get silly, but you'll find yourself laughing away (as I did) at the funny bits. It's not a show that's entirely for kids and adults, because you really need to stay with it for the entire show. And that",1
" Wow, what a great time to be spoiled. This show starts off with a movie shot and the supporting cast shows up, hooked up to a cool camera, to do a quiz show. The show continues with such a great mix of people that you can't help but smile or cringe at the funny-shaken-to-death-bonus moments. ",1

" I have seen this movie so many times, but I can find it amongst the hundreds of others that I have seen the movie in. Yes, it's a dark movie, and it has humor in it, but it can be a very dark movie too. I'm not sure how I feel about the movie, but the story is interesting enough that I still watch it when",1

<br /><br />Next to the first, I have to say that I'm so looking forward to the second of the two episodes, The Man Who Broke The Bank (2002). The show is a biographical comedy, sort of, about the life of John LaBarbera, star of the new sitcom, ""The Man Who Laughs""",1
" It's not a criticism of the show, but I think a show would be best suited to a secret audience, because like I said, it's not really much of an audience. If you love comedy, especially a comedy set at a high corporate structure, then this show shouldn't bother you. If you're looking for the works of John Ritter, then this show",1

 She is dead and gone. The problem with the film is that the closure is never really there. It's not a movie. It's a re-telling of a story. An alibi. No one will ever be exactly the same again.

 It happened to me and here's why. It could never happen in real life. It seems to be the most recognizable film I have ever seen. I think it is a masterpiece of modern cinema. The only thing I didn't like was that the love scenes were rather forced. It was like a kind of battle between the love of the two films the love of the film,1
" A great film. At a time when films are more likely to be defensive than constructive, this film is a must see for every viewer! You'll find yourself telling your friends and family about it. It's a great watch and a very entertaining film. <br /><br />I've been to the Bob's fishing site about the first one and then i saw that",1

 Nothing new to say about this film. Its about a girl who escapes a dangerous situation in order to get away with her life. The only real surprise is the way the movie tries to push the envelope. Its a cliche but one man's trash is another man's treasure ,1

I thought it was well directed, although I think that the script and main characters were a bit thin and it had a bit too much structure for my taste. The whole thing is pretty good. It has some valuable lessons about about the world we live in. The movie is about a company that",1
 A nice movie about a woman who is asked to make a film that will make money for a movie studio. will do it as she is a really nice woman and really well spoken. Martin Scorsese has done some really nice films before this was made. The director is directed by James Toback. It is a good movie. ,1
 One of the funniest films I have ever seen! It is about the death of a man who was going to be killed by a gust of wind.

" This is the kind of film one initially selects to make up the numbers from video rental.....only to discover an under-rated entertaining and enjoyable movie!! The opening sequence of the police arriving at a dark and rainy house wherein the ""wife"" has committed murder.......or is it??....and the remainder of the film seeks to unravel what really happened....OK...the film is",1
" In my opinion, this film is too dumbed down and ""serious"" to be of any use to any who wish to get into the field of action movies. It has a very cold, sadistic feel with some unnecessary gore. Life is fast now and the killing of innocent people is becoming common, and the film is bordering on murder, torture and (obviously)",1
 I found this to be the first film I have seen that I really liked.....with a different theme....and the ending of the film is one of the highlights of the entire film. As a film maker....I have been fortunate enough to work with the director of all of my films....and I could hardly imagine working on a film of hers....which was definitely the case,1
" I have seen this film several times, almost as a quieter-than-usual ""event"" which I have lost the ability to focus on. I enjoy the subtleties of editing and the color of the scenes with great freshness and sensitivity. It is a good film, it is a well written story, and it is enjoyable to watch it. The plot is",1
" This is a great movie! It was released in 1977, and is well worth the time to watch. It's entire plot revolves around the moral dilemmas faced by the two men, Ambrose (Glen Crawford) and James (Edgar Corday). Seriously, this movie is so good that my taste in films is nearly driven out of me. We see the relationship",1
" How about this one: A ""boy meets girl"" tale about a young boy in one of the least developed countries in Europe.....the story itself is quite charming.....the development of the hero's relationship with this girl is not an afterthought. This is a very good tale that shows how a young boy (Eduard) is given a true and deep relationship with the",1
" 5 STARS!!!!! The Astounding World Trade Center is the story of a young man who must decide if he'll be a hero or a coward. He must make a tough moral decision, while the rest of the city is trapped in the rubble where it all went to. The film, like many of the best of the 80's, is all about human emotions. The",1
" This film is well worth seeing if your a fan of political thrillers, or are a fan of German style genre films.....it features the body language of innocence, humor, and comedy, and is a worthy addition to the film series. It features a good mix of comedy and emotion, and the entire cast is very nicely put together and well developed. This is a must",1
" The Russian master of cinematic suspense from the Soviet Union, Larisa Shepitko has little doubt of his goal in the making of this film, the so-determined in her achievement of evoking the spirit of the Nazi invasion in the Dnieper region of Eastern Europe. It is an original story of a group of members of the German resistance who were captured by Soviet",1
" A great addition to the re-release of the Soviet 60s fiction! And a great movie!! Produced in the Soviet Union in 1977, this film, produced by Yuri Gagarin Studios, shows the Soviet Union during its time of war. The film uses footage of the opening of the Berlin Wall, liquidation of the Nazi concentration camps, and the liberation of the",1
" For the price of $85.95 it is not difficult to appreciate the first film from the director of the similar film, ""The Christ"". A very well-acted and well-recorded film about a contemporary social commentary on religion and Eucharist, this cult classic takes the viewer on a journey through the life of Christ. This film is well-loved by Christians",1

With the help of a loose alliance of various spies, the group of agents was able to penetrate and eventually capture six nations during the course of the Cold War. This compilation of films, produced by",1
" If you like a good story, a good acting performance, and a good soundtrack, The Rogue would give you every reason to consider a career in the Italian cinema. This is a well-written supernatural horror film, though one may find it a bit too much to handle. You do not need to see the original to appreciate this film, but if you do see it,",1
" Perhaps the best film on the subject of Soviet Judaism is the long-running feature of the Soviet Union itself, The Ascent. The film, which has been around since 1963, is a thoughtful and moving documentary about the lives of Jews in the Soviet Union, whose only means of survival was to build a community of self-supporting working people. The film is by no",1
" THE ASCENT is one of those films where you can't watch it without feeling a minor degree of guilt for your own actions. In this case, it is the decision to leave your countryside to engage in extreme combat with the enemy. What makes this decision so easy to make is the fact that you are an officer of the German army. You have sacrificed everything for the",1
" This was a pretty good film, and it was well worth a campy re-release. It is based on a true story and based on the play by Fredric March, Jr. In this movie, he makes an appearance as a man, and serves as a liaison between the soldiers and the partisans. It is actually a kind of vehicle for actress Natalie Wood. I",1
" A LITTLE GIRL was made in the Soviet Union in 1956 by a privately financed (and selected) group of Soviet kids (not the kind of group as a group that would appeal to Hollywood, nor the sort of group that would bring in as much money as possible). Little Girl was filmed in the course of a total of ten months, with

" Jennifer Kaye was the Director of Photography for the film, and she is a top-flight actor, with a compelling and almost hypnotic look. She also handles the important moral issues of the film with an exacting precision, something that is not always common for movie actors. The crew was led by the late Paul Steinberg, who was a longtime cinematographer for",1
" A lot of people complain about the lack of originality in contemporary Polish cinema. While a number of films are certainly original, and some are even very good, there is a definite trend in them. The recent release of a recently transferred Polish version of the film by writer and director Iliza Shevchenko is probably the highlight of this trend. Produced in Poland in 1986",1
" Using a combination of the soundtrack and forced landscapes of the Soviet Union and the West, this film has created a spellbinding and emotionally moving experience. The setting, and the mystery that binds the two characters, is just as important as the story. A masterpiece of cinematography, including a few stunning pan cams, makes for an extraordinary film. There is so much to enjoy",1
" Robert Webb, who won both a Primetime Emmy Award and an Oscar for his portrayal of a convicted man, in ""I Love You, Jeaniola,"" (""The Loneliest Man in the World""), is an outstanding actor.

" IL MAZZAMINO, ANCORA! - MAZZAMINO, ANCORA! is a movie I have seen several times, but never twice. It's like a long-lost cousin to Brannagh's Hamlet, but it's also a different, more modern movie - a tribute to the pioneer Italian art, drama and cinema of that era.",1
" This is a film that I have heard many people complain about. I can understand why. However, this film is absolutely amazing. After reading a review on IMDB, I decided to see it. I bought the DVD and I'm glad I did. The film consists of a series of three stories. In the first we see Hamlet climbing out of a ship, and",1
" THE WATERSHED is a movie that depicts the overall moral and ethical dilemmas of the struggle for freedom and advance during the Second World War in the Soviet Union. Shot in black-and-white, with a rich use of close-ups, it is an insightful commentary on the closely-held ideals of a nation that was plagued by mass murder and the",1
" In 1973, Paul Mantlo and M.J. Talbert directed a surreal thriller about a group of vampires wandering the woods of the Southern United States in the 1950s. The movie follows the story of a community of vampires who believe they are ""cursed"" with a supernatural ability to ""walk into anything"" and survive as long as it is dark enough. They are",1
" I first saw this film as a teenager. It was a silent film in the early 1940s, screened to audiences during a small festival in Cambridge. The story is about a man who is sent to the countryside to raise sheep and as it was the first sound film made in the United States in 1940, it was a highly controversial film.

" I have to say that this movie is kinda fun, but it is not totally my style! Its a pleasant and relaxed movie that's perfect for a Saturday evening. ",1
" It's kind of a silly movie. The whole premise is well known, but it's not that well done. But that's what makes it a good movie. And it's fun to pass the time. ",1
" Boom. This is another ""I didn't know who it was"" movie. This is a good movie to watch if you like movies like ""The Matrix"" or ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3"". It's even better than the original. The story was written by Brian Williams. The movie is very funny and very anti-religious. You can't argue with this.",1
" I recommend you to see it while you're young or dizzy, or at least have some healthy dose of youth in you. It's not a movie you can pass off and say is groundbreaking. But it's a movie you must see at least once in your life. Re-imagine yourself as a child of the 70's (not like ""The King's Speech",1
" I get it, I'm a man of science, and I know that almost everything a movie has to do with science is based on probability. I know that even if it's unlikely to be true, it would still be a possibility. So if a movie has to do with probability is based on it, and science has to do with probability, then it's probably science",1
" I am a critic of 3D animation. I have seen a lot of it, loved a lot of it, but not ever a full scale movie of any kind, and even if I saw one, I wouldn't want to see it in 3D. I am a big fan of 3D animation. This movies is a very well done animated movie. There were parts",1
" ""The Lord of the Rings"" is no longer the most popular on the market, but it has been so well received over the years that every Japanese company as well as every Western company has made a copy of it, which is quite a shame as it's not bad. It has still a classic style, with its big funny anime characters and its characters ridden with quirkyness",1
 This is an excellent title to discuss! I've been a huge fan of the series and to learn more about it. It's good to see that this fan has also been able to exchange ideas on the various aspects of the series! The animation is flawless... the music is great and the story is superbly executed... ,1
" A bunch of people are talking about this movie (maybe with some others as well) and complaining about the slightly primitive concept of the story. But first, the story itself. It's a story of a father and his three sons. There are two main characters, played by the same actor who played the father. The father is a sculptor who works in the family studio",1
" This is a nice way to spend a Saturday afternoon (although I'm not sure it's a must-see for hardcore animators). I haven't seen this film, but I would recommend it to everyone who enjoys cartoons. It's a success story, and it's a welcome relief from the rest of the blockbusters that seem to be coming out every year. The film",1
" Quentin Tarantino has done one of the most enjoyable things I have seen him do in 25 years. One of the most dramatic films I have ever seen. The plot - about the story of a black family, is the simple and good thing to have in a movie, but it has the odd person to watch out for. And I liked that. Even though it is a",1
" (quote from the DVD review) In the purist sense of the term, The Color Purple is a film that doesn't pass the test of quality. The dialog is absolutely uninteresting, the dialogue was never once, in my opinion, funny, or funny-enough, so the movie falls short of the mark as a ""classic"". The movie is not particularly good,",1
" This is directed by Brian De Palma, but with the same fashions - to some extent - as his directorial style. It's not a Mickey Mouse movie, but I still like it... It's not a Ralph Bakshi movie, but I still like it... I liked this movie because I was bored for about an hour, and then I found I couldn",1
" Welcome to the world of the ""boys"" of The Simpsons... The Simpsons has been receiving lots of publicity lately, thanks to the release of the fourth season of the series which just aired on FX. This year's ""Walk the Line"" episode sees an 18-year-old Homer in the victim role of his own children and family. His trip to the funeral of his",1
 I have to admit that I was a bit sceptical- but it turned out that I was absolutely right. I thought Disney would bring out a cartoon of the same name - but no. It's based on a German Stern film called Die Zeit (The Time) and it's really good. Very funny... it is a very German-style satirical cartoon that makes the darkest,1
" I wasn't expecting any big surprises in this version of the classic ""The Princess Bride"". What I expected was a movie that would make you fall in love with the characters, the musical numbers, the film, or the soundtrack. Instead I found myself so utterly engrossed in the film that I didn't want to stop. I found this film so amusing I could not",1
" ""Johnson's Birthday"" had me captivated with its humorous, yet poignant story. It was an uphill battle to get the film to work, because of the lack of polish in the story and the somewhat generic look of the cast; I'm glad I wasn't one of the few people who was disappointed too much. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't work on both counts,",1
" I was a big fan of ""The Sandman"" when it first came out (my first experience watching a movie on DVD for anything other than 20 minutes), but this movie is just too good to be ignored. It's a very clever story about good vs. evil and finding your way through the world, and it's got a very good score from me. At some",1
" The greatest thing about this movie is this one's theme - crime and mayhem in the name of justice. There's really no better way to express it. The movie manages to give an actual action story, without the glorification of violence or the callousness that has been prevalent in cartooning over the last several decades. To put it simply - this is a cartoon.",1
" The Matrix is a great movie. That isn't exclusive to the movie. It's a very good movie. It's not the best movie in the world. It's an early contender to the Oscar for Best Picture. The film is made by Wachowski brothers, but it was made by Eidos in 1995. It's been around for twenty-five years and the",1
" An excellent contrast to the other films being directed by Nolan, ""Saving Private Ryan"" captures the horror of war better than any of his previous imitators. The impact of the first action scenes is heightened by the majesty of the ""battle"" itself, even as the story is told in very muted sounds and images. Packed with impressive effects and sound design, it",1
" If you're a diehard fan of the '70s, then you will enjoy The Incredible Burt WonderDoll. The movie is a parody of that era, but it's really a fun and touching story about the adversity of growing up and coping with being a teenager. The main characters are all well developed and the story only gets better as the movie progresses. The",1
" Invader Zim: A Fistful of Fridge-Ones has nearly 25 years of history and is a much better animated short film than some of the more famous and popular of today's cartoon shorts. It's a good time to see this movie, especially since it's apparently one of 2 million or so ""lost"" cartoons ever made... (which is a record",1
" This is the kind of film that helps you to get out of the ""I could never pay to see this movie"" trap of Hollywood. One of the best films of the year. Most of the characters are so unique you forget they all happen to be in the same movie. So you don't need to see every single one of them to enjoy this film. It's",1
" If you're looking for a meaningful reaction to current political issues, this is the movie for you! <br /><br />This film shows a look at the business of running an empire but at the same time tries to show something that many people have been looking for, a strong women who are strong in their own right as separate from their menfolk. <br /",1
" I really love this movie. I saw it again last night and enjoyed every second of it. It's great for kids looking for a slice of life story. It's entertaining, cutting edge, and has some of the makings of a classic animated film. It's probably one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time!! <br />The movie's",1
" Mickey Rourke is a better class of actor than Al Pacchino. The man deserves better than the Oscar he is giving him for the best actor in a movie. With his role as Fernando Lamas in Rocky IV, Rourke, who will soon be premiering a movie with a key role in it, finally delivers his best performance. There's no doubt about it",1
" Kevin Smith's latest film, ""The Craft"" serves as a good introduction to John Hughes' style. Unfortunately, the movie

" Budget cuts are affecting the quality of television and American movies alike, and there are few, if any, worse examples than this film. It's a soft-porn flick with an over-the-top, over-the-top theme, a remake of a good old-fashioned film noir. ",1
" This one is not what you think it is. It's more a romantic movie than a disgusting sex-fest. The problem is its director. The focus on her character is a distraction from the story and away from the sex. John Miller may be the director, but his cinematography is the only thing that saves this movie. ",1
" A film of its own kind, possibly, in that it does nothing without some clear, strong motivations and a great degree of training, then again, so many films did so, and in the long run, would have been a great idea. Reeve is a good actor with some comic chops, and his wonderful performance in this is the perfect counterpoint to the film's",1
" At last, a film that embraces the nature of sex, violence and sex without either wasting it, or becoming the latest victim of post-modern, `thriller' culture. I was reminded of a few of the films I's loved the most recently, such as Reservoir Dogs, The Wrestler and Barry Lyndon. This is a film that could have been so",1
" It's hard to avoid the film critic's pecking order in this one, but I can't imagine anyone who wasn't a huge fan of Austin Powers would miss the fact that John Travolta is back, albeit in a bigger role. It's a fairly lesser known comedies, but it's still hilarious, with Travolta's Tom Cruise being the",1
" This California man's mind apparently has no boundaries, because he went from being a bona fide actor to being one of the most talented directors in Hollywood. As much as I love the gritty, hard-edged style of Francis Ford Coppola, ",1
" Shifting from a very strong series to a weak one, School Of The Eighteenth Century seeks to redeem itself by paying tribute to the great Enlightenment, but ends up entirely missing the point.",1
" This is a very cool movie, with stars, and an even better director than Woody Allen, but it's not really a Woody Allen movie. Mitchell Hamilton's movie seems to be the only one that's really given him a run-around, and it's a pretty good time. ",1
" This was an excellent comedy from Richard Lewis, who has played in the same genre since The Happytime Story, starring Dustin Hoffman, Michael Douglas, and Johnny Depp. It's the way the actor conveys that he is being the actor, and with a realistic and realistic portrayal of the works he is portraying. Wasn't he great in Bridge of Spies? So",1
" I was very pleasantly surprised at the outcome of this film - many thanks to the brilliant casting department. It implicitly asks whether the same male-fronted group of actors that created the current glitzy movie-making industry are capable of any such creative endeavour, a question that very few filmmakers strive to answer. <br /><br />What made this movie so good,",1
" A bit too much like ""Tana the Elephant"" for me, perhaps. I was somewhat drawn into this scene-stealing zoo of sexual fetishism, but it just seemed to me that the comedy and gimmicks were nearly nonexistent in this French-Swiss affair.<br /><br />I've seen these type of films before, and they ALWAYS come to a",1
" Reuben Rental's scathing television series is a film no less an idea, but in this case it lacks the intention to work. The film is a documentary about a former Prime Minister of Afghanistan, who has a sense of humor that was previously lacking in most of its programs. Problems befall the prime minister in this film, though, but most of the film's plot",1
" This film did not seem to attract as many viewers, but it is a comparatively obscure film with some minor issues. There are two positive aspects to this contemporary piece of drama: the first is the use of a strong female presence at a time when women have been underrepresented in recent history, and second is the fact that it is a film that makes a virtue of its inability",1
" Now this would be a good movie when it's just a fantasy, couldn't it? Well, we have to go a little more far back, and go back a few decades, to see it. Now, back in 1973, the John Travolta film Silent Night, Deadly Night saw the public's first glimpse of the real thing. Well, at least IT",1
" This one is as good as it gets (along with the first film in the Hell's Kitchen series). The story of a group of New York City emos, drawn from the ranks of the Grunge scene group, is well acted by Genevieve Summer as the emo leader, and plays to a viewer's in-your-face passion for the music scene",1
" Very well done. Was hoping to see more of the likes of Cat Sanderson, but this was the first time she shares the spotlight with Ms. Newman. The superlative pacing for this movie is quite impressive, and the excellent performances by the cast (especially Noyce, who accomplishes what is probably impossible in most of these situations) make this one of the",1
" A classic example of how to make a horror movie look like a comedy. That makes it particularly watchable for the moviegoer who's looking for an easy-to-like horror flick. I'm talking about the director, Billy Ray, who has made me laugh in the past - a rare occurrence, the way I have been able to witness films with directors like John",1
" The black man's burden. the black man's burden. is the main theme of the film - it is nothing more than the black man's creative process. <br /><br />The film is peppered with numerous memorable scenes and memorable performances, especially Hunter's, and an occasional banal one-note setpiece. The movie is not very long, and as",1
