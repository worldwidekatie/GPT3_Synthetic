" A major disappointment compared to the first two movies in the series. ""Ghostbusters II"" is like a bad imitation of ""Ghostbusters I."" It was completely unnecessary and just plain stupid. The movie has a very slow start with a couple of sleeping sequences that add nothing to the movie except to make a brooding introduction for the movie. The comedy in this movie was not",0
" The story of a man who was an overgrown boy child and the trials and tribulations that he and his wife went through. There is a touch of the supernatural in this film, but it is truly a remarkable. I laughed, I cried, I got angry at the bad guy. I was moved to pity for the bad guy. I thought he was going to be",0
" An exceptional movie, made by people who knew how to make movies. If you want a movie that will make you cry, laugh and feel really good, watch this one. The characters are very well developed. The kids are typical kids, but you still understand why they behave the way they do. Their parents are real people, with real problems. The poor family who lives",0

 The worst movie ever made. I rented this movie thinking it was a documentary. But it was a film. And it was the worst movie ever. The whole movie was about this woman trying to find a man. The end of the movie she finally found a man. But the end of the movie had no point to it. I didn't understand the point too this movie,0
" I know a lot of people will hate me for saying this, but this was a really good movie. I mean, it had some holes in it, but it made a point. In a time when people didn't fight for what they believed in, a woman did. And you can't say she didn't fight for it, because she was killed for it. You",0

" ""Dreamscape"" is the kind of movie that has you hoping it's not going to be as boring as it looks or seems in the first few minutes.

" ""Eight Legged Freaks"" is a light, humorous, but entertaining film that doesn't take itself too seriously and who's audience will be just as confused as the people in the movie. But the film does have an extremely original premise which is what got my attention. A meteorite lands just outside of a small town. Just minutes after the impact, the meteorite",0
 This film is probably one of the better Sword and Sandal films. The costumes and settings appear very authentic and the performances are all fairly convincing. The film's sound track is very well done and the fight scenes are all very exciting and well filmed. The film starts with a young Roman soldier named Marcus being exiled for accidentally killing a gladiator. He is sent to the Island,0
 This movie stars Robert Wagner as an arms dealer who's trying to buy weapons from the Chinese. Some military parts are stolen and the American army finds a way to fight them. ,0
" ""The Big Country"" is a strange, entertaining, and uneven western. It has wonderful characterizations, excellent photography (by William C. Mellor), and one of the greatest high noon showdowns ever filmed. Yet it also has some of the worst dialog ever written, and a ubiquitous soundtrack that can be annoying. If you can get past the dialog and that rockin",0
" Honey Honey- Mary Poppins is my Favorite Movie Ever! It has a beautiful story of a magical dancing nanny and a very sweet family. The actors were great. Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke, and Dick's kids. It was a very heart warming movie. And it always puts a smile on my face. You should all see it. ",0
" This is one of the best documentaries that I've ever seen. The more I watch it the more I love it. It's a documentary about a group of homeless people in Fresno, California. The movie takes a look at their daily lives and the activities they do to pass their time on the streets. It was originally made in 1986, so the film quality is not that",0
" ""Rough Night In Jericho"" is a lot like a fairground ride: thrilling when it starts, but awfully repetitive once it gathers momentum. <br /><br />This thriller is set in a small town in Texas where a man named Kurt Russel listens to a radio broadcast from a man named ""Papa Pilgrim"". Pilgrim believes that God has bestowed upon him a",0
" I guess it's possible to make a bad movie about professional boarders, but it's a lot harder than you'd think. I mean, you've got lots of opportunities for cool action shots, and the subject matter is pretty juicy; but I guess you just need some sort of shame or at least some talent to make it work. ",0
" This is a style over substance movie, which is a bummer. The screenplay is very good, and the direction is pretty solid too. But the acting is not the greatest. The story is odd, and that's part of the reasons why it's so popular. But the acting plays just doesn't quite cut it. Perhaps it comes down to seeing a movie like this",0
" What more can one say about this classic? It's a rocking, funny, slick, and cool flick, with all music being done by the band the Thelma & Louise! (They're all women, and they're awesome.) This version has a great commentary by the director and some of the cast, along with some funny outtakes. The story is simple",0
" The plot isn't bad, kinda reminiscent of The Most Dangerous Game. The scariest part is the location, a creepy dilapidated house out in the middle of the woods, but it somehow makes for a pretty good setting. William Shatner plays a psycho killer and does a very good job at it. Not as good as his performances in classic movies like The",0
" I really liked this movie! First of all, I think they did a very good job trying to show this life-changing experience so difficult for everyone. It's not easy to adapt a book like ""Mauvaise Passe"" and make it a movie! This is a journey among other journeys, they all pass by the same places, but they all take different",0
" Borderline pornographic exploitation. Not sexy, just boring. The idea of a guy plotting to get away from his wife with a young girl and her mother is not exciting. If you're into that sort of thing, you'll like this film, but from my point of view, it was horrible. ",0
" This is the WORST movie ever. It has no plot, no characters and the actors suck. Don't waste your time or your money. I wonder how good the reviews would have been if, as with most bad movies, it was an art movie. ",0
" This is a very ""A Clockwork Orange""-like movie, in the sense that both are based on the works of Anthony Burgess. Yet this movie is very evil and disturbing to watch, with scenes of dismemberment, torture, and rape, most of which is seen in lurid close-ups. The violence is not presented in a funny or shocking way, and there",0
" A nice film, which is easy to watch, even though there are some slow moments. It's hard to relate to the main character, but one still feels to be concerned about his fate. I would recommend it for people who enjoy films about sailing, although it's a bit too slow for such a film. ",0
" One of the worst movies i have ever seen. Okay here's the breakdown: This movie is about some kid in a juvenile detention center who has no real friends, so he makes a pet out of a bird. The bird dies and the kid makes a new one out of the other birds in the cage using a dead bird and feathers and stuff. That bird dies in an",0
" 'Worst movie you ever saw' was a phrase coined by my friend Ben Eubanks. He used it to describe a movie so bad that it actually felt good to watch. The movie that started it all was 'Danger: Diabolik'. This film is that movie. You know how when you see a movie and you're like, 'Wow. That",0
" One of the reasons that I really enjoy the ""Friday the 13th"" films is because of the superb editing by Carol A. Daley. Everything is just so perfectly timed; the music, the visuals, the gags. She did her best work with the first two films, and it is to her credit that she was able to keep the series enjoyable, despite the",0
" This movie is almost unwatchable. It's slow, the story is lame, and it's just plain stupid. I'm sure it will hold some kind of nostalgic value for some people because it's a classic for them, but I've seen it, and I really don't care to ever see it again. Except when it's on TV (which happened almost a",0
" I laughed so hard that I cried. It's the first movie I've ever seen that I wanted to see again- the first that I could watch over and over. It's so ridiculous that it's funny. And it's not just the plot, it's the dialogue- the sex scenes, everything. It's like a soap opera. I loved it. It's",0
" Has some really good music and performances; Kid Creole and the Coconuts, James White and the Blacks, DNA, Tuxedo Moon, the Plastics, Melle Mel, Vincent Gallo, Lydia Lunch...etc, but aside from this there isn't much more to it. The dialog, especially the narration(by Saul Williams), is actually pretty good,",0
" An all time favorite film of mine that goes under the radar. What can I say, I'm a sucker for the kind of film Rififi was, films with a very tight script and stylized direction that are almost directed like plays. Rififi is the cinematic equivalent of a stage play, and I'll always fall for it. And it's not just because",0
" The original ""Goldfinger"" was a departure from the second Bond film, the campy ""Doctor No"", which by today's standards is quite good. However ""Goldfinger"" took Bond to a new level of sophistication, but it's also a darker Bond film. The film is rich in detail, and the opening sequence is the best of any Bond film. Pierce Bros",0
" You know, this is one of those rare instances when a movie I have mixed feelings about.

" I could not get into this movie. The plot is interesting enough, and the acting is good. But, the story is never really developed, and the lead character is never really fleshed out enough. Maybe it would have been stronger if it were a 4 episode mini-series on TV instead of a 2 hour movie. ",0
" I had to take a long time to sit down and finally write a review about this movie. The reason is that I liked it a lot, it was an enjoyable experience. It was like having a fun adventure sitting in the cinema. I liked it so much that I had to take time to figure out how it would be fair to rate it. <br /><br",0

" I like most movies with Jason Statham and don't much care for his 'tough guy' role, but Bullseye more than made up for it. Yes, a classic story of revenge, but with a great twist. Statham's character is a patsy, just a guy that gets stuck in a spot he can't get out of. But he",0
" The 3 stars is only for the film's technical achievements (the script, the acting, the direction, the cinematography). The story is pretty boring, and the acting is far from great. All of the actors seem to be playing it safe and not trying to be particularly good or bad in their respective roles. The actors who played characters that were supposed to be attractive and",0
" It's not a very good movie, the camera moves very fast and it makes it hard to follow the story.

I wouldn't recommend it to anybody who hasn't seen it yet. If you",0
" Just like you'd expect it to be: A complete, and I mean, COMPLETE let down. I mean, what were they thinking?

She went from a strong, old woman who was a",0

 the movies was great very entertaining and humorous i love the movie it was so funny and worth waiting for a long time for it to come out. I think sarah michelle gellar was great in this movie and i hope she continues to do more. I love the fact this movie is comedy and horror together. I think the person who played the queen is so good looking,0
" . Such a shame that this movie is not available in widescreen format. It's a classic with an all-star cast and great musical numbers. Story line follows the plot of the original pretty closely, but it doesn't have the magic. ",0

" This film is like the bad, re-released film that they put out on the PS2, it is exactly like that. I'm not saying that it was the worst movie ever because there are many films that are just so bad and terrible that watching it is just so painful to do. But this movie is just so stupid that it is funny. The acting is horrible",0
" I have no idea how this film has any kind of positive reviews. It just doesn't make any sense. Yes, it starts with a fascinating idea, but then it just meanders along. It relies too heavily on the performance of one actor, and the rest of the cast is quite weak. The look of the film is quite awful (little girls with cleavage scars",0
" To call ""Rocketship X-M"" a science fiction classic is due more to its release date (1950), its savvy ability to capitalize on the publicity for ""Destination Moon"", and the appearance of actors who would later star in television as Sea Hunt's Mike Nelson, Rockford's dad and Wyatt Earp.<br /><br />The movie itself is bad",0
" This movie was pretty bad, it was a waste of my time, right from the first scene I knew it was going to be bad. I knew that it was going to be a bad movie from the very first scenes, and I was correct. I didn't like the movie from the very first time I saw it, it was not something that I would watch again.",0
 I thought that this was a good movie and I highly recommend people to watch it.

The scenes in the hospital are especially",0
 I was not expecting much from this movie and looked forward to a good laugh. I was not disappointed. I can't decide if I am laughing at the movie or with it. All in all a very funny movie.

 I remember the first time I saw this film and I was blown away. I remember putting it on again and again and again. I remember watching all the behind-the-scenes videos and reading all the books.

" First off, i havent read the book, and will probably never read the book, as i'm not much of a reader. And to be blunt, the movie was pretty bad too. It seemed like they tried to cram too much in, and it was way too long. Some of the actors were obviously not their best, and the plot was too simple to explain",0
" First of all, I don't understand why anyone would give this film less than 1 star. I love the film and even more so since John Travolta played the character.

It was billed as a comedy, but there was nothing funny about it. The storyline was just plain confusing and the jokes were just stupid. What really disappointed me was the fact that they billed it as",0
 This movie is so bad that the director should be ashamed to have ever made it. The acting is horrid! The cast should be ashamed of themselves for ever making it. It was not even funny in the least. I felt sorry for the actors getting involved in this. I am actually glad it was only a short film. It gave me hope that it would be over,0

 I was not prepared for what I saw when I watched the trailer for this film. I was expecting a cheesy ass horror film but what I got was a well acted film with some real scares in it.

The movie is a good watch but you need to pay a lot of attention",0

" What an absolutely dreadful film. I'm not really sure what the director was trying to achieve. To make a semi-poetic art house movie? Maybe. Or was it trying to tell the story of an anti-hero? I'll have to give it the benefit of the doubt and say yes. The problem here is that the characters are so flat, so uninteresting",0

" I'm afraid I enjoyed this far more than I should have, as it is a big example of the decline in standards of scripted television drama.

Thornton plays a",0

It's a good story, a good film. I guess if you don't like romantic movies you won't like this movie. REVIEW",0
" I loved this movie and the romance is something that makes it worth watching. The problem is that it was evidently made by some sort of machine that takes movies and generates the same kind over and over again.

" This one has a great cast and an unusual premise, but it fails to deliver. The B plot is tedious and the rest is too cartoonish for its own good. I've given it 4 stars, but I've never seen it again. I was hoping that it would be a lot more than it ended up being. Somebody please tell me I didn't miss something!",0
" I really enjoyed Napoleon Dynamite. I thought it was hilarious. It is not a traditional movie but I think it's a great movie. I don't know if it's for everyone, but it's definitely for me. It's a really cute movie that can make you laugh. If you like movies that make you laugh, you should see it. ",0
" I had never heard of D.B. Cooper before I saw this film. It only took about thirty minutes in for me to get hooked. Cooper was a real-life criminal who was smart enough to make away with a ton of money and without being caught. To this day his identity is still unknown, and the true story of this mysterious man is very interesting. I",0

" This is one of the biggest, wettest flops I ever saw. The casting is horrible, the story is truely boring, and it's hard to believe that Sean Penn would be in a movie like this. I mean, I guess he still has some guts, and he thought he was being challenged and creative by trying to make a truly bad film. Well",0
" I watched this movie with my wife one day and while I found it to be a very entertaining movie, it is WILDLY overrated. The story draws its inspiration from one of the most famous political assassinations in history. However, the bad guys are some of the most stupid, incompetent fools to ever hit the silver screen. My wife and I both think that this",0
" I just saw this movie and I don't understand why it made so many lists. I would have to say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's not funny it's just stupid. I can't believe how much hype this movie had. This movie is a joke. The whole movie is about how he shoots different people, gets drunk,",0
 I liked this film for the most part. I think that Marley deserved a better ending than the character received in the beginning. It is not one that I will be watching again. ,0
" I love the ""Scary Movie"" series. I thought the second was the best but this one takes the cake. The best part for me was when the football coach talks to the little kid in the locker room about the story of the curse of O'Bannon. It is so funny and I laughed the whole time. I think this one was better than the second",0
" I was left cold by this movie. It was a lot of hype and not a lot of substance. I don't know, maybe it was just me, but I just didn't think this movie was that great. I was expecting a lot more from this blockbuster. I guess it could have been my mood or the company I was with, but I was just not impressed",0
" Well what can I say about this film. I am a huge fan of anything that ends in the word 'man'. Yes I have read the book, and yes I admired the actors in this film. The direction was great, and the acting was...well ok I can't say ""great"" but I can say ""adequate"". Overall I had a good time watching",0
" Having read the reviews for this film, I was expecting not to enjoy it but was pleasantly surprised by it. It is no masterpiece by any means but it is a fairly good film with nice direction and the acting is quite good. I was not a fan of David Duchovny as Mulder, but the intensity and tenacity of the character changed as the series progressed",0
" This film was hard to get a hold of, and when I eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming.

With all of this built-in interest, how could",0
 I have put in an enormous amount of time and effort into making this documentary. I did not intend for my life to become this way. I would not have believed it was possible.

" This movie was very interesting and hard to follow in other ways. A lot of the story lines was good, the acting was good, but the story seemed to jump from place to place. I would have liked to see more of the main story, which was not really a story in itself, it was more like a side story, or a story that wasn't a story",0
 This film was absolutely astounding. I think it was my favorite of the Harry Potter films. It had a different feeling about it than the others. It felt more real and emotional. It felt like I was there. I loved the emotions that the characters gave off and how they made you feel the same way they felt. This was an amazing film and I'm glad I have,0
" I don't understand how people can praise this film. There are a few very good moments, most notably the opening scene when the monster appear to be stalking the group of people. The second half of the film is all downhill from there. I went in to the film expecting a serious horror, and instead got something that was more sci-fi than anything. I don't",0

" This movie is being advertised on cable as a horror movie, which it is not. It has a few horror scenes, but it is not scary. I think it is misleading.

" Had to laugh at this one ... while watching it I kept thinking 'The Wicker Man' meets 'Deep Throat' ... what a combo ... instead of one long scene of the mystery surrounding the kids' disappearance, better to break it up with some sex ... the mother, the cop, and the douchebag at the drop-in center. That would have been",0
" I hate this movie so much that I can't even think of anything else to say. It's totally campy, unoriginal, offensive, and stupid. Anyone who liked this movie should be ashamed of themselves. ",0
" A short film that was obviously very stagey and it took me out of the movie. The acting was just as bad, but I didn't expect too much from a short film. The main character was a wimp and too much of a goody-goody for me, I know you probably need a character that was innocent and a bit dorky in order",0
" I bought this movie on the back of the stunning box art, and the fact it was a 'twist' film from this year's festival. I hadn't seen a bad review so far, but after the first 15 minutes I knew this film was a turkey. I agree with other reviewers that the film plays out like a well-made amateur film, but that's",0

" If you are a fan of the original series, you will be shocked by how much they have changed the characters. Especially the characters that were so cute in the original series, such as Alice, who now looks like a man in drag.<br /><br />For anyone who is planning to buy this movie, I would not recommend this movie for adults because quite simply it",0
" Not too bad. I enjoyed the movie for the most part. I didn't care for the ending though.<br /><br />The Cusack character is so whiney and annoying. The ending where they try to escape the island was pretty cool. Not too much action, but just enough. ",0
" I was so shocked by the negative reviews of this movie. I think it is very well done. I think it is realistic in terms of how people would react to a situation like this ( i.e. hiding out in the house, having family tied up, etc). I find it funny that all of the critics seem to have never seen a horror movie before. Also",0
" While this is a good movie for those who are interested in the historical events surrounding the fall of the Berlin wall, I think it is too long. There are too many repetitive scenes, too much 'philosophy' and not enough action/drama. ",0
 What is the big deal about this movie? It's a movie about a female dog that swallows the whole nation's money. That is all. It's not funny. The dog is not cute. The dog does not have a good voice. The dog does not even have a voice. PROBLEMS: <br /><br />- When the dog is,0

I never ask for a refund on any movie, but I think this will be a first.<br /><br />The movie is so bad that I had to stop after just 15 minutes",0
" It seemed funny at first. Kinda like a modern day Three Stooges. I almost turned it off. But it just kept going. Then it became a little more disturbing. Its just basically a bunch of really stupid guys posturing and trying to be funny. Its not funny. Beyond the stupid premise, they didn't put any effort into this crap. I felt",0
 My friend recommended this movie to me having seen it before but I had never heard of it nor have I seen any trailers for it. But I knew from the moment I watched the movie that it was going to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. This movie is about an elderly man who one day finds a child who he mistakes for being his long lost grandson,0
" This film is something that is hard to describe in a few words. It's an extremely metafilmic movie which deals with what is real and what is not real in life. It's got a lot of symbolism and some extremely weird scenes. It's not one of those movies you can just sit and watch without paying attention to every detail, or you'll miss something",0
 This was the worst movie I have ever seen. It was like watching paint dry. Don't even get me started on the ending. Nobody should waste their money on this god awful movie. <br /><br />The only reason I'm giving it the rating of a 1 is because I had to. ,0

" This film is Bad. Really Bad. The acting is wooden and the editing is hideous (there are blips throughout where the sound cuts out - these are not due to dodgy copies).

" This movie is so bad that you want to walk out the theater but can't because you actually have to walk all the way to the concession stand in order to get your ticket refunded.

" Better than I expected. Not really a comedy, more a tragic story of a man who looses his way in life and is sort of happy with it. The cinematography and acting are top notch. ",0
" This movie is just horrible. I keep trying to think of a way it could be good, but I just can't. I was dragged to this by my sister and a friend. They didn't care for it either. The acting...the music...the script...the story...the overuse of the word ""bitch""...it's just bad. I fell asleep",0
" I saw this movie at the theater when it opened. I enjoyed it, but i was so disturbed. The killer was wearing a halloween mask. That's why he was the joker. In the comics, the joker is crazy because of a chemical accident. I told my friend that if i ever saw the joker without his mask, he'd probably look",0
 I thought this movie was good and interesting. Not typical. I give this movie 3 stars. Good acting. Kept me wanting to watch. All in all i would recommend this movie. ,0
" I love this film. I cannot stress that enough. I have already seen it 3 times this year and I will see it many more times after. It is a fantastic, original, fascinating story from beginning to end. I love the characters, the narrative, the cinematography, the acting, the music, the lighting, the colour palette. I love the costumes, the",0
" I'll start off by saying that I've already read the book, so I knew about the ending before I saw the movie. That's not to say that it wasn't a good movie, it just wasn't as good as the book. I liked the fact that they tried to keep it true to the book, but it was just a little too slow. It was",0
" A great movie, reminds me of the early Hitchcock films. Luv the theme song as well! ",0
" In the first half of the film they employ a lot of mystery and suspense, which makes the film interesting to watch. The second half obviously has to include a big, climatic battle scene, but they handle this in a way that doesn't ruin the mood. The film is well paced and edited, and the CGI is not bad at all. The plot is well thought",0
" The film is about 2 people from different walks of life, who both experience the same dream while sleeping. The dream is about a deserted island, a theme park... and a cannibal tribe. In the dream, the man and the woman meet and the man helps the woman escape from the tribe.<br /><br />The story is very cool and works well for the entire",0
 this is the worst movie ive ever seen. And i have seen lots of movies. Me and my friends rented this one a wendsday evening. Man we had lots of fun. This movie is the worst most boring crap ive ever seen. But it makes you laugh! U will lay on the floor rolling around tryin to get some air. You wonder why,0
" Not bad. A lovely film with well casted actors and good acting. But the plot is a bit confused and things happen very fast that makes it hard to follow. Good performances from Renee Zellweger, Brendan Fraser, and Ewan McGregor. My favorite was definitely the lead Michael Douglas. He was the glue that kept it all together. <br /><",0
