0," This movie is one of the very few true stories from the '40s that I'd actually recommend to friends. Of the many popular movies produced by Warner Bros. at the time, few can be said to be as emotionally true to the real life events of the time as 'Concho.' I especially loved the final scene, in which the town falls into a state of",1
1," For the crew and cast, the picture was a revelation. The Amherst Cinematheque in Amherst, Mass., was a test for the entire crew. It was a big set-up, with several costume changes and heavy makeup effects. The result was a dazzling film. The beginning of the film is beautiful. Before the camera zooms in on her,",1
2," I've hated this movie ever since I first saw it in '45. The main problem is that this movie is the definition of cheap. It is one of the most pointless attempts at a bad Western I've ever seen. It is a disaster. Apparently this movie was made as a vehicle for the actors who were under contract to Johnny Bench and Benny Baker, and it robbed",1
3," The picture was restored in the early seventies with a color restoration and then in a 16mm master print in the late eighties. The new restoration was done by John Paul Bode and Stanley Burrows, who had pointed out one of the most obvious issues with the restoration was the viewer's eye in the picture. The two seem to have a sense of humor and said",1
4," I have watched many movies with an affinity for ""The Magnificent Seven,"" but the one I most enjoyed was ""The Magnificent Seven,"" directed by John Ford. This movie is classic Ford, and the sardonic dialogue of Conrad is a delight. The story is based on the legend of the ""Seven Treasure Hunts,"" and was based on a novel by Nathaniel Hawthorne",1
5," The man who directed 'Concho' was Oscar-nominated for the Oscar for best director. He goes on to say that the movie he's worked on, 'Brotherhood,' was also nominated for best director. He has an interesting point: 'The tone is much more serious in 'Concho' than 'Brotherhood,' and when it comes to spirituality it's",1
6," In 'High Noon,' Larry Fournier is a young man with a tragic past. His father was killed in the first hours of the battle. His mother was left to carry him into the future. His brother is also gone, but his only parent is his sister, and so he and his family are reduced to the status of strangers. The young man's self",1
7," The movie is a wonderful movie and made me cry. I have not seen the movie before but I have adored the first two 'Magnificent Seven' movies. This one is better, and it uses every word in the movie. The story seems to be about a small group of rebels who escape from a harsh life in New Mexico (they had to lie about being a",1
8," If there's one recommendation for the film-goer who misses this film because of one episode or one incident, it's to check out the next best thing, the one that that wouldn't be the same as 'Concho.' If you're not quite with me, here's the synopsis to the story: When high school geography teacher, Mr. Conchos,",1
9," Wow. What a ride. I've been a movie buff for a very long time (and never have I seen a movie that I've been so obsessed with). But this is THE movie for me. The music is especially impressive, though I doubt that anyone can 'hear the music' when they listen to it. A wonderful way to wrap up a long night of",1
10," When I started this movie, I thought it was going to be a good, solid showing of this movie. I enjoyed the acting in it. The acting was fine. The movie was enjoyable, except for a few unimportant scenes. It was not worth much money. I found it tolerable. I watched it in October. I had no desire for it. I think",1
11," In a sequence that The World Has Never Seen, Ronnie Cleveland (Will Smith) discovers that he's the son of a leader of a tribe, and he soon finds that he's taking over his own younger brother's father's tribe. Unfortunately, the leader has been killed in the line of duty, and his body's exhumed to discover that his corpse is of an",1
12," After seeing 'I Walked With A Ghost,' I thought this was an excellent remake of the original 'High Noon.' Even more interesting is the presence of both Father Kelly and William Friedkin. They both draw you in so quickly, you start to forget that you're watching a remake, and that the original is a story of war, bullets, death and human frailty",1
13," I've seen a number of Sinatra movies and, as the saying goes, Sinatra is an artist who is never satisfied. While he never really achieves greatness, the rewards often don't outweigh the risks of his work. This time, with his tribute to his late friend, a young woman he's met at Broadway and 62nd Street, he's making the most of",1
14," This film is the epitomy of a ""perfect film,"" just what one needs to make a great 20th Century-Fox classic. An ill-fated picture which needed to be made to make a great picture, it's now impossible to know what to make of it because the film has become so quintessentially about ""homey"" matters. It's prime territory",1
15," This was the first Sinatra film that I saw at the age of 11 and I was so blown away by his performance that I have not been able to put it down since. I've been to see a lot of his movies since then, but I was so eager to see Concho, ""The Story of Concho Mex,"" that I went to see it on opening",1
16," I met Jeter at a club and he invited me to the 2nd party. We danced to the sound of the party, drank a lot and danced to heavy metal music. I was able to go part of the way to a party I enjoyed, and to have been part of that party. But I had the opportunity to take the last two of those two trips and",1
17," This is an improvisational drama, and the intense and often bizarre performances by the star of the picture, Julie Andrews, are part of the magic. The story of a group of college students reuniting with their old married partner suspected killers, and their subsequent cause of action, is not one for the faint of heart. It's not a conventional Hitchcock thriller, but it's",1
18," I thought that Frank Sinatra was on his way to becoming one of the greatest and most popular singers ever after the release of 'High Noon' when I saw this. He was playing hundreds of country songs by artists that he had sampled in previous productions but was never quite able to translate into his solo recording. Now, no more. But what a heartwarming story it is",1
19," I'm rating this movie on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 if I ever see it again). This movie is a classic and it's nearly 40 years old. It's about a girl who lives with her mother, her sister, and her grandmother, who is a very caring, loving, and compassionate person, but who, in the movie, has totally lost her",1
20, I'm in love with this film. I think the movie would be better if you think about it a little while before you see it. That is something that I watch movies because I want to know what the movie really is. I'm going to say that I think it deserves to be watched. It's a good movie right? If it's good then it's worth,1
21," I really enjoyed this movie as I thought that it was going to be a lot more dramatic than it turned out to be. I think that perhaps Mrs. Moss would have been more convincing if she didn't have that stalker in her life. She played the part very well against the script and I have to give them props. Overall this movie had me a little nervous,",1
22, I really enjoyed seeing the movie. The story was very well told with variety of characters and the plot was well developed for such a small film. This movie was plenty of fun for kids even if some of them may not understand the movie plot. The acting from the cast was well done with an enjoyable storyline. ,1
23, This one is a bit better than the previous. I don't think I would watch it all the time if I had to do it. It's not bad but I don't see a lot of the appeal that I saw in the first one. Which is why it is a good movie. It's really well shot and well paced. And makes use of good camera angles,1
24, I am not a fan of this movie. I mean I think that if you wanted to see a movie which would be a thriller then this would be a movie to see. I mean I know that it has a horror element to it but as a movie it wasn't really a scary movie for me. I don't know if a movie like that would be a good idea,1
25, I am not a huge fan of this series. I don't think I can say it is good or bad for me. But I have seen the first five episodes and I was not a big fan.

26," I am going to put this on my future ""Mystery Movie"" list because I really liked the way this movie turned out. I think the part that made me love this movie the most was the storyline. I thought the story line was actually pretty good and I was less frustrated with the characters because I knew that they were going to end up together. I give it a",1
27, I wanted to like this movie. I actually watched the trailer and I wanted to see if it would be good. When I opened the movie I was pretty close but I was just not sure I liked it. It was totally different but I don't know if that was a good thing or not. But when I watched the whole movie I was okay with it. I didn,1
28," Just wanted to say that it's a very funny movie, it's not your typical horror movie. It's time period which I think is great especially the late 70's so it's not a thriller type of movie. The horror is created by the terrifying character of the killer and the humor comes from the way the victims feel. The movie is pretty concise and the plot is",1
29, The DVD is pretty good. There's a little bit of different things that happen. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good movie. And of course you can't beat the great celebrity actress Alicia Silverstone. ,1
30," I love this movie! I thought that there was a lot to like about it- the ending, the main character, the story, the actors and the direction. I could really see how this movie could be used as Halloween theme. I had a great time watching it. It was very creepy all the way through and the ending made me cry. It just makes me want",1
31, The movie is fun to watch. I guess it is just that it is a scary movie and that it is not really a funny movie. I think it would be better if they would have kept it a bit more normal. I guess it might be better if they changed the ending. But my husband and I are hoping they cut it just a bit. My husband didn't,1
32," I have seen this movie again and I really liked it all the way through. It is a nice story, but a little too predictable for my taste. I feel like I could have raised my expectations a little more. It seems like the whole movie was like a typical horror movie version of ""Chicken Soup for the Soul"" in a way. I mean every scene is sort",1
33, Fantastic! This was TERRIBLE! I can't believe that this movie was not actually overhyped. I have seen this before and it's just horrible. I have gone into it with high expectations but this movie almost squashed them all. Kevin Dillon is very able to bring the two roles together. I think if you are a fan of Christian Bale or Michael C,1
34, I have seen this movie and even though I kind of knew who the killer was from the beginning I still liked watching it. I would recommend it to other people. It comes on Lifetime movie network quite a lot. And I am thinking since it's close to Halloween they might play it more. So please be on the look out for it if you are interested in watching it,1
35, I am so glad that Rachel McAdams did not play the hardest part in this movie as she did not play it as the hard part. I think that the film was more of a comedy and needed a bit more of a cohesiveness between the characters. The performances of Johnny Depp and Alicia Silverstone were great. They were good. I almost love them. They,1
36, I actually kind of liked it. It had a lot of depressing moments along with the humor. It seemed to me that the story wasn't very deep. It wasn't really anything that makes the movie stand out. It was a pretty good movie per say. It's kind of like a sad movie. It had a depressing scene with a pretty well crafted storyline and a pretty,1
37, I have watched this movie a few times and I have to say that I liked it. I liked the movie and the way I was watching it and I thought that it was a good movie. I don't know what the ratings are because I went to the movie with my husband who I shouldn't show the movie. It had a bad first half of the movie but I,1
38, I really enjoyed this movie that I haven't seen in a long time. I think that John Scott Taylor left it really good.

Not too many people know who Ralph Bakshi is and this movie does nothing to make that popular. The movie is full of humor and some of the best moments in my opinion are when Ralph Bakshi comes up with a cartoon style with little characters, little action, and a bit of narration. The animation is pretty good with good shading and shading detail.
