" This movie was pathetic, the special effects were terrible, and it was too long. It was a waste of time, money, and celluloid. Perhaps, that's why they refer to it as Anthroploic. I encourage all to stay away from this film. It's a shame that the movie did not earn back the cost of production and marketing. RE",0
 I caught the Sci Fi Channel yesterday airing this film. It was mildly amusing to watch. It's not a great film by any means but it was interesting to view a 1950's drive on the cosmosphere. Space travel was a mystery to the public in the 1940's and the 50's when this film was made. I enjoyed the way the director made this film.,0
" ""Fan-tas-tic"" is indeed the word to describe this film. You'll see a lot of stars in this film that you know and a lot of stars that you don't know. First off, the film is set in the future. When the earth is dying, humans have set out into space in search of a new world to call home. The",0
" Boy, is this movie loaded with stereotypes, but who cares? This movie is so bad, it's really good. The acting is campy, the writing is really bad, and the special effects are laughable. The film is pretty silly, but that is it's charm. It makes you laugh because of it's general badness. And the worst part? THAT DAM",0
" This film is just plain awful in every respect. The plot is a silly rehash of invasion of the body snatchers, the acting is atrocious, the dialogue is cheesy and the direction is amateurish. The premise is so bad that I wasn't even sure that I had the correct title of the film. None of the actors even attempt a convincing American accent.",0
" This movie isn't about space exploration or science. It's a story about people exploring their desires, their lusts. It's a movie about sexual repression. ""Three thousand years as a slave,"" the space captain (who's really a Martian) says. ""Three thousand years of wanting you, always wanting you, and having to watch you in the arms of those men",0
" This movie is horrible, terrible script, bad acting, boring scenes, and the space ship is made out of cardboard and the special effects are sometimes cool but sometimes stupid. It is so bad I had to take it off at one point. I have never done that in my life. There is only one word for this movie, garbage. ",0
" I am rolling on the floor laughing at this movie. I have a copy on VHS. It's very funny, at times. I did some research on the internet, and apparently, there are a few classes of people out there who enjoy this movie. Part of the reason I enjoy is it's so terrible. It's a very low budget movie, and the actors",0
" Nowadays, critics often just recycle the same phrases over and over again when writing their reviews. One of the phrases that gets thrown around a lot is ""derivative"" or ""spirit liftingly derivative"". This movie is an example of being derivative. It's virtually a lift off of ""The Fugitive"". But of course, it wasn't their fault. It was",0
" I got this movie for my birthday in 2000, it is by far the worst movie I have ever watched, I wouldn't even think about recommending this movie to anyone, I visited the website for this movie and read the plot and stuff, and I thought this movie might be actually good, well it wasn't, I would give it 0 stars if I could, this movie",0
" I've seen this movie long time ago, somewhere between 1997 and 1999 when I was 12, I just remember it was a total crap in my opinion. There were some pictures that were terrible and the actors sucked, the story was just terrible and I had no idea what is going on. I mean, I just felt like I am missing something here. Anyways, if",0
" This movie aint no great classic as its been labelled by some, but it is a very fine and enjoyable movie for what it is. A 50s space adventure. The story is set in the fifties. It has all the cliches of 50s sci fi movies. And to me that was part of the fun. You got to love the fift",0
" This was a great movie. I was a tad disappointed with the todays movies. I think back to the movies of the 50's and 60's and think, ""boy, I sure did love those movies"". I'm hopeful that a movie like this will come out again. I was disappointed in the Matrix and MIB movies. I'm all for comic books and action",0
" The film takes place in a post-apocalyptic world.Most of the world's population was killed in a war caused by nuclear weapons. The survivors have formed small tribes to survive and they live in fear of the mutants, who are probably mutated humans. They have numbers, but one of the main characters of the film is a mutant (who is a pretty decent guy,",0
" Typical cheesy 50s movie with B movie actors, awful acting, and what was someone thinking when they filmed the scene with the ""flying saucer""? I'll watch this movie even if people try to stop me. ",0
" This movie is bad in the fact that it has a weak story, bad acting, and unfunny humor. However, I have to give it a star for the fact that it is so bad, it's actually funny. It is the only movie I have ever rented that I actually enjoyed making fun of with my friends. The characters are so poorly developed that you can't",0
" If you don't have an IQ higher than a dog's, you'll love this movie. Other than that, you'll find the film slow and boring. The plot follows a group of astronauts (led by James Best, known for his role as Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane on Dukes of Hazzard) on a mission to Venus, where they land",0
" The MST3K version of this film is far better than the original. A young John Agar stars as the commander of the X-M probe rocket ship. A team of scientists led by a young Forrest Tucker as Prof. Cook (who seems a little too comfortable with the ""girls"" in the ship) and a young Faith Domergue as Dr. Ruth",0
" I really liked this movie. I had heard there was a lot of homosexuality in it, but I didn't see much of it. The only thing that concerned me was that the ""evil"" man seems to have a lot of gay friends. I don't think they are gay, but the whole movie seems to be too pro-homosexual for me to enjoy. Otherwise",0
 I think that this movie is a must see for any person that loves a bad movie. I'm sorry to say that the acting is so bad that it is good. I enjoyed it so much I got three more people to watch it with me. I have yet to find anyone who has seen this film and not liked it. You can't take it seriously. You will,0
 I can't believe the amazing consensus on this film. It's terrible. I can't believe someone gave it 4 stars. Unless those 4 stars were awarded simply for the existence of Joan Crawford in a movie that doesn't make a lick of sense. What does this movie have to do with the title? NOTHING. And the 2 girls play the same character in the,0
 This is a very young and inexperienced Leonardo DiCaprio doing his best work. This movie is very good for you young people who are into this sort of thing. I would not recommend this film to anyone who is into any kind of Horror or Gore. ,0
" A very well done introduction to a person who will become one of the most powerful and influential in American history. Alexander Hamilton is played very well, and it is an eye opening piece of film to watch. If you're not in to history, this movie won't do much for you, but if you're interested in learning more about one of America's greatest men, this",0
" Im a big fan of the original ""Aliens"" and was looking forward to the new director's vision. While I still think this a solid film, it lacks the focus and intensity of the first one. Some of the most memorable scenes are when Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is alone and the aliens are not around. However, this time, the bulk of",0
" I've read and seen plenty of reviews bashing this movie, but it really deserves it. It's a rare thing, but this movie fails to live up to it's hype. It's a great cast, but the performances and dialogue are flat, and the plot is done to death. In short, it's a boring movie.<br /><br />I'm a",0
" Not a bad movie. Directed by one of the Coen Brothers. It's got good performances by John Goodman and Frances McDormand. Goodman plays a doctor who, with a young African-American nurse (McDormand), picks up a prostitute (Holly Hunter). The movie takes the viewer through a series of encounters and meetings with their pasts and presents",0
" I consider this to be one of the greatest comedies of all time. It's hilarious! I first saw it on tv when I was 8 or 9, and it still makes me laugh. I had to get it on dvd so I could watch it whenever I want. It's stupid, but it's funny. ",0
" This has been a favorite of mine since I was a kid. Sure it really doesn't make total sense, but I don't want every movie to have to be ""movie logic"" anyways. The story was unique and fun, the special effects were great for the time, and (for it's time) the acting was good. Sure William Hopper is a little stiff",0
" This movie is highly overrated. The story was just so-so at best. The characters were just so bland. The only thing that saves this movie is the visual effects and the music, and even that is minimal. The whole movie is just so poorly written, but there are some redeeming parts. If you want to watch something that will truly scare you, watch",0
" This movie is fun and entertaining for the whole family. A good three hours of entertainment for a rainy day or weekend. Okay, I admit that ""The Quest"" isn't a great movie, but it's fun and well worth renting if you have a rainy day. The good:<br /><br />1. The film was clearly made on a small budget.",0
" If this were a real movie, I would give it a zero. The plot is so absurd it's funny. The movie is also very slow moving, boring, and stupid. I mean, a woman being whipped and raped in the middle of the desert with the one guy there standing and watching? (And the guy was the director!) Then, pretending it didn't happen",0
" I'm not one for documentaries, but this one is a hoot. These guys are young, smart and funny. Having done this gig for several years, they've got a lot of stuff to say. They're not famous, yet, but I'd put money on them being the next ""Spinal Tap."" I can't wait to see the movie they make about",0
" I saw this movie years ago as a double feature with ""The Monster That Challenged The World"". I was impressed by the special effects, but I would have been more impressed by a more complete story. The basic plot of this movie is that a marine biologist, played by Richard Carlson, is trying to figure out why a particular type of octopus is so aggressive and why",0
" I'm the person who wrote the second review of ""People Are Funny."" I'm so glad it was my opinion that was posted. It's nice to see that there are still some people out there who believe in fairness and decency towards others. You could see in the eyes of the little girl who played Susie that she was truly enjoying doing what she did. What a",0
" As I stated in a previous review, I found it interesting that Warner Brother Studios would own the rights to the picture. Well I was right about that and Warner Brothers under the supervision of the Warner Archives Group present us with this bare bones, but very nice looking, edition. The film was directed by Charles Lamont and it stars Robert Lowery as ""Blacky"" the",0
" ""A Night Inside"" is a bit of a sleeper. The cast is great, with Anthony Newley and Donald Sutherland headlining. The action is good, the story tight, and the photography is beautiful. But the movie is entirely at the mercy of its music. That would be Newley's music. The songs are catchy, but they also really suck. I'm",0
" I don't know what everyone else was thinking when they saw this movie, but it was one of the best comedies I have ever seen! Usually I'm really corny, and I don't mind that, but this movie was hilarious! The movie was basically about a trio of idiots that rob a bank and get into some crazy shit with the cops. Or at least",0
" I watched this movie twice, and I believe it could be the opposite of ""The Shack"". It seems that some people might have had a similar experience as had Mackenzie in this film. Maybe, they became Christians afterward. So, for some, it might be the opposite. For others, just a more biblical, more accurate portrayal of God. ",0
" It's not that this movie is so bad, as that it's so sad. It's as if the producers and writers of this film looked at every aspect of the horror genre and said, ""How can we make this even worse than before?"" I don't think such a sadistic effort has been accomplished since. This movie is somehow able to make the hair on the",0
" First of all, Charlton Heston was a great actor, but I think it was the first time I saw him in the role of a Mexican gunman. The plot is completely weird. If you can get beyond the racial stereotypes, it's not too bad.<br /><br />What is interesting is to compare what was on the screen in 1952 with what was happening",0
" ""Titanic"" has that magic touch that Hollywood blockbusters need. The mix of thrills, drama and romance will send you to the moon and back, if not also make you cry. The film starts with young Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) traveling to the coast of England to find a way to America, while his ship sinks right in front of",0
" i was left deeply disappointed by this film. i went in expecting something along the lines of ""confessions of a dangerous mind"", but this was so far removed from that. jim carrey's acting is usually good. not this time. i kept waiting for something to happen but nothing really happened. the plot was weak. there wasn't enough humour and the only part",0
" I have recently rented this movie to see for myself why people seem to like it. I am not a horror fan, and so I was surprised to find that I did like parts of the movie.<br /><br />I found it interesting that the film was based on a true story and that it reflected the time period in which it was made. The atmosphere was lively",0
" This is as good a movie as you can imagine it to be. The story, the plot, the action, the characters, and the effects are all unbelievable. I strongly recommend it to everyone, not only for the action and thrill, but for the message it sends as well. It's a must have.<br /><br />This is the best movie in the",0
" The Space Odyssey continues after the original movie left off, this time concentrating on the exploration of Jupiter and its moons. It may be hard to follow at times, but if you stick with it, it is worth it as it is the most realistic telling of space travel that I have ever seen.<br /><br />The first part of the movie is the story of Dave",0
" An intelligent satire using the trappings of the ""haunted house"" films of the 50's. It has a classic structure and a nice pace. The actors work well together and there are some surprising plot twists along with very good special effects for 1959. Also a good theme song.<br /><br />This was the film that made Vincent Price a star. REVIEW",0
" When I say that I like Woody Allen movies, I mean his earlier stuff like Bananas, Sleeper and Love and Death. This really isn't what I'm talking about. In fact, I'd say that if it wasn't for all the hype and his name being on the poster, I probably wouldn't have even read the ",0
" I'm torn between two and a half stars and three stars but I think I'll go with three stars. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are both very good actors, I just think that in this instance they were miscast. Winslet's British accent is so terrible that it distracted me for most of the movie. I'm not sure why there isn't a",0
 I thought that this film was great and i would recommend it to any one. The story line is very interesting and has enough twists to keep you involved. I think that the acting was great and the plot was extremely interesting. It is not like most of the films out there today where they are just out to gross you out and make you laugh. There is how ever some,0
" This will appear on a future version of Mystery Science Theater 3000, if not in an upcoming Rifftrax release, which I hope happens, because this is just stupidly bad. It's as if a bunch of ADs were watching the first five minutes of ""Island of Lost Souls"", the first five minutes of ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"", and the",0
" The first two minutes of this movie are burned into my mind, but were they worth it? No. No they were not. While not a total disaster, the first two minutes of this movie were so bad you can see why it was cut from the film and dropped to the special features section of this DVD.<br /><br />The first two minutes of this movie",0
" This movie has a great story line and some good scenes which pretty much makes it a must see however I was sad to find that the Blu-ray version has very poor picture quality and a poor sound mix, which is a shame as the film is one of the best in the series. For gamers, it has some good scenes which make it a must see. The good",0
" When I was in kindergarten, I loved this movie. I remember being scared and intrigued by it. I had the VHS and I would watch it all the time. When I was looking for a movie my son could see, my husband said that he remembered this movie scaring him when he was little. My son is also very sensitive, so I thought this would be",0
" This movie is the perfect example of a bad movie. It is a bad movie because it stars Dolph Lundgren, the same man who was in ""Rocky IV"" (the movie that has the BEST movie villain of all time) and ""The Punisher"" (the movie that has the WORST movie villains of all time.) Dolph Lundgren is not a",0
" Here it is, the big one! The movie that practically defined an entire generation, or at least a certain segment of it - the generation that grew up in the '70s and came of age in the '80s, and is now in its mid-to-late thirties. I'm talking ""Star Wars"" here, the movie that everyone has seen",0
" Years ago I saw this movie on the late show. I fell asleep. I found I had a spare hour the other night and decided to see it again. I found the movie to be poorly written and acted. The plot was thin and uninteresting. I kept thinking I was going to see something exciting or gripping come on, but it never did. I only gave it",0

" I'm not a big fan of Kung Fu movies, but I am a big fan of karate movies. So this film is right up my street. The plot is based around the movie star Jet Li who plays Kwai Chang Caine a Shaolin monk in the 18th century. The movie is a mixed bag of Kung Fu and karate. In fact it is",0
" Along the lines of the 1950's science fiction films that were aimed at kids, Bell, Book and Candle (1958) is a charming movie that purports to be a romance, but is actually a silly fantasy flick for kids. James Stewart plays a witch, but not the evil kind. His witchcraft is mostly used for making attractive women fall in love with him. While",0
" So I've been reading various reviews for this film and I must say I'm a bit confused, so many people have said that this is the best film of the year, that this is the most innovative and ground breaking film in a long time. Is everyone just being lame or what? I mean the film was alright, but nothing special. The story is very cliché and",0
" When I went to see this film I was expecting a scary film, but was disappointed to see that it was a comedy with a few scary scenes in it. It follows 4 friends as they go to the annual spook house at their college, but something goes wrong and they find themselves stuck inside with a killer on the loose. Now of course, most people in the film",0
" In the space of a year, five women have been killed by brutal attacks and each case is similar to the one before. The police bring in a profiler, a man who can help them by finding the type of person that would carry out such acts. There is a slight difference though. This man doesn't have all the answers, he is a man and there are",0
" The Bizarre movie of the year. This film is so over the top that it's hard to say if it's a comedy or a drama. The acting is like a bad high school play as it's all over the place. The script is so odd and full of ""life's mysteries"" to a point where you can't tell if it is trying to be a",0
" I went to see this film because it was on and I was bored, I wasn't expecting much and so that's why it's so bad. If the makers of this film had tried a bit more it could have been a bit better. It was similar to any romance film where the guy friends with the girl and then they fall in love and then the girl dumps the",0
" There's a lot of hype surrounding this film and while some of it is warranted, it is also a little over hyped. Firstly the gangsters are a little bit silly and the plot is just plain stupid, but what would you expect from a gangster film. The characters are good, but again a little bit too stereotyped, it's nice to have a gang",0
" Well, I went to see this with my GF and we thought it would be a good way to spend a saturday night, and at first it was fun. The start was good, and we laughed at all of Adam Sandlers jokes (well it was very funny at first). The problem is that it was trying to become more of a drama/romantic comedy,",0
" This film was hard to get a hold of, and when I eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming. I mean, this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century: an unknown man takes advantage of the unsuspecting airline industry and GETS AWAY with millions in ransom without hurting anyone or bungling the attempt. With all of this built-in interest, how could",0
" This movie was a revelation to me. It was directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. There are a lot of movies out there which I don't like all that much, however this one was great. It was weird but I enjoyed it. I liked the way the characters were hard to relate with, but in the end they were just like every person you ever knew. This movie",0
" This is a really great and original film, and the story of a man who has to think outside of the square to get away from his despondent life, but with the added twist that he is married and has a child so has to think twice about what he is doing as he doesn't want to hurt anyone. The story is based on the true life incident where",0
" The fact that this film has been sitting on a shelf for so long must be down to the fact that by the time the film was ready for the screen, Tim Roth was already a world renowned actor. This film is basically a celebration of what he would become. He plays a man at the end of his tether, because of the death of his wife he just wants to",0
" The movie ""Sunshine Cleaning"" is about a mother and daughter team of two cleaning women who are trying to raise enough money for the mother to quit her job and become a hairdresser.

" I'd heard so much about this film. My friends had praised it to me for ages, and I really wanted to sit down and see what all the fuss was about. So I did. I sat down. I watched it. I sat through it. And then I came up with one conclusion: this is a good film. But it's not great. You can",0
" This movie wasn't awful but I also didn't think it was that good. The acting was just so-so and the end was very disappointing. I watched this movie with my best friend and we were both very disappointed. If you want a good true story, watch ""I am Sam"". ",0

" This movie has become a classic due to its ingenious plot and its enthralling script. Bruce Willis and Samuel L.

I mean, who could have seen that one coming? All in all, I",0
" It has a high concept premise, but it is a very poor execution. The story is basically there, but too much of it is too obvious and it comes off as a really bad parody. The humour is mostly juvenile and the acting is not convincing at all. The story is way too predictable and there are no twists or turns like you would expect from an M. Night",0
" I love watching documentaries about what men think of as ""normal"" and what men think of as ""abnormal"". This is one of these films and it is a great one.

" There wasn't much to this movie. It wasn't that it was a bad movie, it just was an average movie. The movie never really explained why the girl went back to the guy, and you didn't really feel sorry for her when she found out about his baby killer past. Again there just isn't much to the movie. I guess the movie was really wanting",0
" Although I have no idea how they managed to do it, in this film you are taken on a journey through some of the most desolate and harsh and hostile places and even though you as a viewer are only seeing the place through the lens of the camera, the visual effect is staggering. When you see things like the sand dunes, the seemingly never ending lakes, the mountains",0
" When I watched this film I didn't know what to expect. I was not entirely sure what it was about. I really enjoyed it. For me, it was a funny romance with a dash of sci-fi. I thought the actors were good. I would definitely watch this film again. ",0
" Forget everything you ever thought about vampires. This is not a movie for or about little girls wanting to marry a vampire. It is not a movie about a vampire falling in love with a human girl. It is a movie about a vampire hunter, who is also a vampire himself, but only part vampire. This movie is also not about a vampire who drinks blood and eats people",0
" This movie was slow to get going. Once it did, it was captivating. It was very well done, very dark and intense. Great performances by the leading actors, and the supporting actors were good. The plot was somewhat weak in some places, but all in all a good film.Not for the squeamish, as there are some intense scenes. REVIEW",0
" The film itself is a little bit of teen-flick heaven with its romance, its drama, and its comedy. But, in my opinion, the film could have benefited from a little bit more comedy. I enjoyed the film, but I thought it was a little bit too serious. After reading the book, I thought that the movie was going to be appropriate for all",0
" First off, I am going to tell you that I am not really a movie buff and I have never read the book which this movie was based on. But I know the story very well.

" This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I went out on a limb on this one as I liked the first and the third movies and I thought it would be better. Don't waste your money. The plot is pointless and there's no real character development. The characters just are who they are. The characters are paper thin and they do silly, random",0
 This is one of those overly busy movies where it's pretty much just a stream of musical numbers with a thin plot around it. It's not completely awful and it's entertaining and I enjoyed it in parts.,0
" I don't believe in giving a film a bad review just because I think it's bad. I don't believe that should influence my review.

" (Actual Rating 1.5 Stars - It was sooooo bad it deserves a half a star)For a movie that made over 300 million dollars, this movie was horrible. The acting was horrible. The plot was non-existent.

" Bad movie with a premise no more or less original than many others of its kind, except that its from the producers of Saw and Insidious, so you might think it might not be too bad (but then again, if you've seen those two, you're as bad a judge of movies as I am). In fact, it has the worst script I've seen in",0
 This was a very average movie. It was ok but nothing special. There really wasn't much to the movie really.

" I saw this film last night and for a while I had been dreading it. I didn't know what to expect, but as it turned out I was pleasantly surprised.

 What can you say about a movie that starts out cute and funny and then descends into comedic hell? What can you say about a movie that is tagged as a musical and doesn't have a single good song in it? what can you say about a movie that wastes good actors like Eric Idle and Sarah Jessica Parker? What is there to say about a movie that does have,0
" The movie is a sequel to ""Escape From L.A."" and it is good. Kurt Russell is back as Snake Plissken and he is even better than before. There are several good things in the film; the story is much better than in the original film and the action is good. The sequel has some good twists and turns and you don't know what",0
" Like the first two movies, this was absolute trash. It had a great concept that was executed poorly. The story was far to predictable and the action was very uninspired. It was like they were trying to make it more like the first two movies but didn't know how. The only reason I watched it was to see the 3rd installment, but it was not worth",0
" This is hands down one of the funniest movie's ever. All the comedies that come out today cannot even compare to how funny the Naked Gun was back in the 80's. Take that with a grain of salt though, only because the Naked Gun was the first movie I ever saw and still to this day is the funniest thing I have ever seen. If you",0
" This movie was just amazing. There was some pretty good action, two of the best actors ever, and the director of this movie really knew how to capture the essence of it. The movie was a little slow in the beginning, but then it really picked up. The ending was great and after it was over it was hard to believe it was over. This movie is great",0
" I have seen this movie 5 times. It is one of my all time favorites. I laughed just as hard the second time as I did the first. I have never seen a comedy movie that had so many hidden jokes, and sayings and references to other movies. This movie is one of the best comedies and it should be seen by everyone. ",0
 This film is an action comedy. It's about a group of criminals who are cops in the future. They are after a black market genetic supply of the pre-pulse period. The leader of the gang is a woman. She has a kid and she uses him to get the information. The cops are after the supplier and the gang who are after them. That's,0
" I saw this film when it was first released and I was disappointed. I didn't love it. It's not that it's a bad movie, but few would call it a great movie. I had seen it again recently and I only liked it a little more the second time around. There is something about the film that makes it a little more interesting than it had been",0
" I'm not sure what everyone else is seeing here, but I read the critics reviews and some of the fans of this movie, and I have to say that this movie seems to be a little more over the top than I was expecting it to be. Or maybe I'm just tired and shouldn't be watching it. I don't know, but I'm pretty disappointed.",0
" Yes. That is how I feel about this movie. It is a very sad story of a dedicated father, who just wants to have a child. His wife is in fact very much pregnant, yet they lost a baby and they can't seem to get pregnant again. This movie gives you a very accurate view of what it is like to be infertile. The narrator",0

 I was really excited when i first heard about this film. And i really saw it as a good opportunity for this young talented boy to show what he's got.

 So I awoke on the 3rd of June to find out that Rosemarie DeWitt has been cast as the wife in the film adaptation of 'Stolen Summer.'I was pretty upset about this and I decided to write a review explaining why.This will also be my first ever movie review.So now let's get on to the review.Who is Rosemar,0
 This movie is stunning to look at. The farm house is absolutely beautiful and built to perfection. The acting is top notch as well. I could really buy into the characters and the story. The tension builds very well in the movie and leaves you wondering what is going to happen next. Its a very unsettling movie. The characters do a very good job of getting you to think,0
" Great in its simplicity, this move is no Ordinary Love Story. It is amazing that the producers of this film were able to make something with so little drama and action. The actors did a great job and the plot is exciting enough to keep you watching, yet it is so low key that it seems like the actors didn't even try. The happy ending is a little",0

" What can I say? This is a great movie. It is not scary, but you will laugh your ass off. The movie revolves around a cast of six college friends who go to a remote cabin to party. A couple of them are at the cabin to prepare for a wedding. What they do not know is that there are three murders. A couple, in their twenties",0
" This movie should have never been made. It was bad the first time, and they thought they could revive it. It didn't work the second time.I think they should give up on this franchise.<br /><br />A better idea: just flush the whole idea down the toilet. ",0
" Without a doubt one of the worst movies ever made. I don't think I've ever been as disappointed in a movie before. I'm embarrassed to say that I bought the ""special edition"" of this movie. I wish I had it back now. The cheesiest dialogue, the worst acting, a plot that makes no sense, and to top it off the most stupid",0
" The most utterly predictable movie I have ever seen. I see it coming as soon as the movie starts. You can't even be a little surprised by this. If you want to see a good movie, do not choose this one. ",0
" As I watched this movie, I thought to myself, ""Wow, these guys are really good actors"". But then, I realized that they were actors. The ones in the movie I mean, not the ones in the audience (although most of them were too). I was wrong. They are really good actors. But that was not enough.<br /><br />I",0
 This is by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen. It is not scary at all and it just feels like it is dragging on and on. The ladies in the movie were all fat and ugly which is never sexy to watch. Then towards the end the movie gets a little bit funny because they are all naked but that is the only funny part. So don,0
" I do not know who this director is or what happened to him, but what the hell happened? This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is a complete and utter waste of time. The best thing I can say about it is that I can not remember a single thing about it. That is a good thing because I tried to forget it as soon",0
" I have never been more horrified in my life. You can't even begin to comprehend the level of stupidity displayed in this film.And what makes it all the worse is that it's a Syfy movie. It's not like they were going for a lowbrow, low budget type movie. That's the kind of thing I can forgive, but this is so bad,",0
" If you're looking for a movie that you can watch over and over again and still be entertained each time, this is the one for you. Nicolas Cage does a wonderful job on this movie. He is a brilliant actor, and this is another one of his masterpieces. I loved this movie so much when I was in high school, that I had it on VHS",0
" Take a look at the poster. A few people walking in the fog and a strange apparition in the distance? Sounds like a good old fashioned ghost story. That's exactly what it is. The first 10 minutes of this movie are absolutely horrifying. You have no idea what is going on. Coming from a guy who thinks most ghost stories are stupid, this movie really surprised",0
" I took a chance on buying this movie based on other reviews and it was a big mistake. It was a waste of my money. I should have listened to the other reviews. It's not any good at all. It should be called ""The man who blows his nose on the kitchen floor"". I would not recommend it at all. ",0
" I don't know if

I have ever seen a movie that was so bad, yet so good at the same time. The acting was so bad that it was laughable, yet the jokes were so bad that it was still funny. If you love low budget B movies, then you will love this. So bad it's good. ",0
" I saw this movie and at first I thought oh this is going to be a great movie. Then, I realized that no, this is going to be a good movie. And, then I just realized this is going to be a bad movie. And, then I realized this was not a movie, it was an entire different species. It was an insult to the viewer",0
" This is one of the most pathetic excuses for a comedy movie I have ever seen in my life. I can't believe this is even shown on Comedy Central. There is virtually no continuity throughout the movie, it's just one long boring scene after another. There is no joke without a punch line. It almost seems like these guys have no idea what comedy is all about.",0
" A horrendous waste of time.The guy who played the priest was funny, but the rest of the movie was a cheesy waste of time and energy.I'm surprised there's not more negative reviews on here. The reason for this must be because all the people who have watched it are too stupid to know what a good movie is.The only interesting part was when the main",0
" This is without a doubt the single worst movie I have ever seen. The worst part is that I actually paid $6 to see this dog. A good movie doesn't try to make you think all of it is real. The ending of this was so pointless too It was so disappointing, and it kept me wondering where it was going. The acting was horrible, and I",0
" This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. The movie was so bad I forgot to laugh.<br /><br />I would've walked out on this movie, but I went with some friends.<br /><br />What a waste of my time. ",0
" I just saw this movie and I must say I was highly disappointed. The preview was great, but when I saw the whole movie I was immediately disappointed. I can not even give it a single star. The beginning was decent, but the way it ended was worse then an episode of The ronlim show. The story line was weak, like if you were going to",0
" When all is said and done, it might be worth watching again if you can just wait to rent it at the 99 cent video store. It does have its funny moments.<br /><br />But as far as the jokes go, I was very disappointed. It just seemed like they were trying too hard. One joke was just one too many. It was time to",0

" I'm usually a great fan of all things Japanese and this film is no exception, although the unrealistic storyline and lack of logic gave me a bit of a headache. Either way, it was a great movie. ",0
 Amazing film. A great adventure with powerful dramatic scenes. It starts off with all the aspects of a classic film but as the story evolves it evolves into something new. It's very inspiring and a great film to watch. ,0
" This movie is terrible. It is a good movie it is really really good i love the movie, it is a family movie so be prepare. ",0
 Joe Rogan is an arrogant ignoramus who throws around the word retarded whenever he sees fit. He has a God complex and is a completely ignorant person. He is a disgrace to comedy and should be hated. ,0
 It is not what I was expecting from this movie. The theater was small and was not clean at all. There was an explosion on the screen and there was a huge patch where the carpet was burned and the wall appeared to have been burnt. The seats were old and breakable. The movie was rotten and the previews were not even good. I would not even recommend this,0
" What a waste of talent and potential. The acting was fine, but the script and direction SUCKED! You know a bad movie is out when it's being shown on the SyFy channel.

" Without a doubt, the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I guess it is a like a bad joke that you just want to get over with. The plot and characters are shallow and unbelievable.

" I saw this movie about a week ago. I can't believe there are so many positive reviews for this movie. Maybe the people who liked it were drunk or something.

 A lot of people will probably think this movie is very stupid. I think it's a pretty scary movie. It's not blood and guts but it's kind of creepy. It's about the Devil and his minions. They want to take over the world. They want to be the new gods. There are some nice twists. I recommend it for people who want to watch,0
" This movie is terrible. The main lesson to take from it is that if you are going to make a 'found footage' movie, you need to have something interesting happen.

The rest of the movie is him telling his story; and the story is told",0
" This movie is interesting, but it is so so slow moving, you want more action, more suspense, a little more thrill. The suspense was so slow you could feel it slow down even from your couch.

It's a little longer than it needs to be, but with all of the big names included, you can't expect a short movie. I give it four out of five stars",0
" This movie is a modern cult classic. It is not only a cult classic because of the famous cast but for the way the story was told.

 This movie had one of the greatest story lines I have seen lately. The plot was superb and the cast was excellent. You will not regret watching this film.

 This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. It's poorly constructed and has a predictable script. The actors are terrible and speak in a monotone voice. The special effects are bad as well. The ending is not satisfying and leaves a lot of questions unanswered. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. ,0
" First of all, you have to put yourself in the mindset of the director, who says this is a sci-fi movie, but much more of a psychological thriller. The main character knows he's in a movie, and knows that the people that are making the film are trying to do something psychological. That's the most important thing to remember. The main character is much",0
 I finally got around to watching this movie after hearing lots of rave reviews for it.

 Good vs evil with a fantasy twist is a concept that has been done to death. But the way this movie shows that dichotomy is far from the typical Vampire/werewolf/angel/vampire/demon/vampire/werewolf/demon/angel/possessed-human-turned-wolf/vampire/demon. ,0
 There are only a couple of things I liked about this movie. I liked the chase scene in the woods. I liked the scene when they are running through the city streets.

 This movie is about a writer who starts to intermingle real life with the imaginary things he's writing.

 I saw this movie with a friend and we were completely bored. The plot is very thin and the acting is not good. It looks to have been made for TV. It is full of cliche's and is more a cliché itself.
