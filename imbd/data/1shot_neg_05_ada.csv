" To call ""Rocketship X-M"" a science fiction classic is due more to its release date (1949), its clever use of the publicity for ""Destination Moon"" and the appearance of actors who would later star in television as the Rockford-based Mike Nelson, who played Wyatt Earp on the original series, can be seen in the number of well",0
" A modern-day national security agency, the United States Air Force's Strategic Reconnaissance Office (SRO) goes down on a mission called Project Alpha Centauri. They're targeting the planet, and you play a MIKE NELSON, the father of Rockford Earp, the legendary Marshal of the US Marshals. EXTREME ACTION, GUNFIRE, AND",0
" The idea of a space race is often based on the fictional race known as the ""Monsters on Wheels"" in the early years of Star Trek's television. It's a bizarre, if not outright silly, yarn, but the implications are so far off the ground that it's hard to consider it anything other than popular space speculation. After all, the space race is a",0
" The basic story is as follows: Mike Nelson has been caught up a rocket ship through the skies, and now the government has sent out three men to help him bring him up to speed, but he finds that the rocket ship is malfunctioning. Desperate to get his boy to safety, he is forced to take the rocket ship's controls and train his young crew on how",0
" But first, let's talk about the movie. A bit of a gimmick to the plot, but fun. The plot is a little thin, but fun. It revolves around a physics professor who has an interest in helping NASA develop a bigger rocket called the ""Rockship X-M"". He explains that he bet the federal budget would suffer if not for his efforts,",0
" The movie contains some very interesting ideas and details that cannot be overlooked. However, the movie itself lacks a coherent plot. ROCKETSHIP X-M is about the search for the alien ship called ""RESONATION X"" and the mission to find it. It is about the government and their plans to lure the X-Men to its discovery. But despite the CGI scenes",0
" I can say with 100% certainty that the movie is a bad idea.<br /> It seems like every person I've talked to about the movie has had the same response: ""That's a bad idea."" The fact that the movie's concept is so bad is no consolation. It is a ridiculous and silly idea that should have been discarded years ago. The concept of a",0
" If you've never seen the MST3K version of this film, then you won't have to wait long to see this. This is a pretty convoluted story with a lot of exposition and the characters are a bit too small to really do a thing with, but it's still fun to have the characters do anything. I haven't seen a MST3K movie",0
 The most interesting thing about the movie is that it's more about science than it is about action. The story is a short story of a space race between the US and the USSR; the theme of which is epitomized in this short while also being a big help to the pacing of the movie. The movie tries too hard to have a story like this that will sell,0

Mike meets his new wife, who is also an actress, Amy Nelson. Rockford also works as an insurance investigator.",0
" The story of ""Rocketship X-M"" is fairly long and interesting, and has a few positive aspects. First, we learn a little bit about the story of the X-M. The most interesting part is the discovery that the X-M was the only object capable of climbing the moon, and that it had intelligence. We also learn that in order to",0
" While it's an OK comic book adaptation of a science fiction novella, the movie is a complete disappointment. I've seen it several times and have enjoyed every moment of it. Better yet it's a movie that COULD make sense in the classroom.

" As the name suggests, this movie is a science fiction tale based around the redemption of a bad guy (Dr. Miles Stephenson) who is responsible for the destruction of several planets. He refuses to pay for the destruction of Earth, but is faced with an impossible choice: either pay for Earth's destruction and help save other planets or destroy Earth, causing it to crash into a",0
" Rockship X-M is a fascinating science fiction mystery. It follows the story of Derek Selley, a professional astronomer who is dealing with a case that involves a group of aliens that fight for control of a planet. He is in charge of finding an alien aircraft that would devastate the planet in order to release the event's contents. He is, of course, an",0

" ""To say the oddities of the R&D process are at least slightly ludicrous is a strange and often self-contradictory statement, and each time we witness the production of NASA's finest programs, the film is a reasonable example.

" There's a reason why “Destination Moon” was so popular.

" ""Rocketship X-M"" is a grim satire of our nuclear age, based on a book by Thomas Pynchon. Both the title and the setting (nuclear weapons) are based on Pynchon's own book.<br /><br />The movie itself is bad enough to be good fodder for MST3K and is best viewed with commentary",0
