0, I saw this a week before it came out. It was a Halloween treat for my family. The cast was great. The script was especially nice. Its what we need more of. We need more of these. ,1
1," This is a movie that you know you'll enjoy but you also know it's not going to be for everyone. The film contains scenes that are highly graphic, but is also very funny as a result. There's also the usual aura of stupidity, but the film is not a mental-health film, and the jokes are usually genuinely funny. The moral message is not necessarily",1
2," So, what are we to make of Carlos Romero's Syrup? Won't it be the next Ray Harryhausen? ",1
3," I've seen a lot of movies that are mediocre and have absolutely no redeeming qualities, and a lot that they're great and have absolutely nothing redeeming qualities. I'm not here to say that some of the ""great"" movies in history have flaws that make them terrible. I'm just saying that a lot of them lack much in the way of redeeming qualities.",1
4," This film offers the best representation of rock music in the years since the rise of the blues. The cast members of the band are uniformly great, and the whole production is streamlined and relaxed. The production design by Daniel Soldati, catering to the tastes of the times, is certainly a highlight. Rock is still the movement of the times, and if you've never seen it",1
5," Clint Eastwood and the guy behind Vegas, a great combination, B- bad acting and a ton of stupidity. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that was so flatheaded and so nasty in the hands of the director. But then he's an actor, what's not to like?",1
6," My first time with this movie occurred by chance, the same week I saw the original movie in 1957. It was released on Christmas Eve in that year. I was in the cinema going into work but hadn't driven home yet. I kept looking for my car, thinking that if it wasn't there I might as well go see it at home. I didn't find it",1
7," AND THAT'S THE THING. Oh, yes. This film is essentially a sex comedy. Oh, yes indeedy. But it's not a great sex comedy. It's a great sex comedy. But it's not a great sex comedy, and the reason it IS a great sex comedy is because of the movie's unity of purpose. ",1
8, Cap'n Cook? I think this movie is the greatest piece of cinema ever made. This is a masterpiece. I know this movie is for fans of James Cameron and Matt Damon. I don't care. The best movie I've seen in a long time. ,1
9," The movie is a showcase for Clint Eastwood's tireless dedication to censorship, which will be on permanent display in his new film, Aronofsky's The Wrestler. The concept is cheap and cliched and makes veeeeery little sense. Even so, it is fascinating character study of Wrestling legends Atticus and Randy Savage. ",1
10," Thanks to the discovery of the black humour intrinsic in the movie, I totally fell for it. I read the book and skimmed the rest. Aye, so much for science. I liked it and loved it, but it was a bit too heavy on the soap opera aspect. But is it all over for the inanity of your expensive movie? Did you have any",1
11," If you're a fan of the old romantic comedy, then you're in luck here! The story revolves around the game of golf and its allure of the wealthy and their young women. The story is very much about a tenacious gamblers and a wily casino waitress. The movie is a classic of the genre. ",1
12," The Power of a Woman is one of the most consistently good movies I've seen in a long time. It's got a great mix of comedy, drama, and action. It also happens to be one of the few honest-to-God, non-sex-based films ever made, based on the experience of a pair of women. That's right; the film",1
13," This is just another movie of the week. On my list of a few films to watch this week, this is one of those I don't pick up on the first take, but watch back to back really well. The movie is directed by Gerri E. Thomas and is basically about a man who, being a man, has to grow up. His mother is the",1
14," This film is sooo much fun! It's a story about two brothers who are just trying to figure out how they can get away from the family business. They end up in a brothel and the brothel somehow allows them to stay there all the way home. Well, they get their sweethearts there and the scene begins. (And if you haven't seen",1
15," I've been a fan of Australian director Kerry Black's work for a number of years, and he was definitely doing his best work then and continuing to do so today. If this is the early 2000's Black festival? Just as good. ",1
16," If you have seen The Yemassee, or The Pony Express, or even The Night of the Hunter (a fine film ), you might like this flick. However, I have seen these films several times before and felt like I was fooling myself if I thought this flick was going to be any good. I thought that the film was so utterly vapid, I",1
17," Well, that's what I think, anyway. The man's so busy being a crook that RKO also managed to seek out the man who led the Chinese revolution. This movie had no political value, and I'm not sure that it's even possible to do justice to its list of talented actors.<br /><br />But what I find most impressive is that",1
18," One never knows where to start a review. It would be hard to start without saying that I'm a huge fan of this film, and that I think the movie is brilliant. It's a good story, but it also relies on you to be a good viewer, and not just think of every scene before you were to see it again (although you won't know if",1
19," Set in a small town in Nebraska, this is a ""Wes Anderson"" film that quickly and effortlessly defies everything that is considered cinematic history, the very thing its creator has paradoxically been attempting to prove in the first place. The film's most interesting and powerful moments come when it crosses into the realm of surrealism, infinite optimism and free will. In this,",1
20," I just absolutely LOVE THE MOVIE ""The Ring"" (1953)... It's a very unusual film. It's a very excellent film. It has amazing sets... great colors... great locations... and good performances from John Mills, Jack Palance, and Ted Knight.... It's a hard core picture... but it's one I'm in love with.... ",1
21," I'm a huge fan of David Hedison, and the movie that he directed: The Dog Who Came Back will always be one of my favorites. What could be more appropriate than to watch a movie that takes itself so seriously... a movie that takes itself so seriously...? ",1
22," I saw this movie on a Saturday afternoon in the theater and I liked it so much that I had to go see it again the following Saturday.<br /><br />And even though I thought I understood the film by heart from the very start, and though I possibly might have been influenced by the fact that the story was written by Charles Burnett (who wrote the script for",1
23," I have seen this film LITTLE more lately than ever, coincidentally during the day I am writing this review. I was a bit disappointed that it was not a group-based movie... A society-operate movie... But it's kind of a good fun movie too. I liked and loved the main character, Vinnie Baker, early on in the film.",1
24," I can't recall the last time I saw a film so loaded with a lot of extraneous, unnecessary things. I can't watch a film and hope that it's decent. I can't even look at a normal movie and expect to enjoy it. I'd rather see a film than watch a movie I don't enjoy. Besides, consider this: after watching this film",1
25," I'm not sure what the hell is going on here. Just a movie that needed a little more work than the acting, directing and cinematography in this one. ",1
26," Well, it's Christmas time and my wife's been wanting me to make a review for her Christmas gift. Well, it's time! Christmas came early for me this year. As a Steven Spielberg fan and a fan of True Romance I was looking forward to a Christmas movie about a man who's been in love with a woman for ten years. I thought this would be",1
27," This movie stars Susan Sarandon and was released in 1955. I've seen the video several times, but it seems there are no analogs in the USA. There's no music, no sound effects. It's just a picture. I've been on the fence about this movie. I always thought it was a commercial stinker. It didn't hold my attention and I",1
28," This story involved the two main characters (Matt and Luke) having to work together to get a ranch out of the grime and mud of a working out camp. The camp itself looks like a lot of other places, have a few drawers full of papers with low-contrasts and a bank vault with a few backup notes missing. The story is simple enough,",1
29," When I'm not making movies I enjoy critiquing people's opinions about movies. Here's the result: A review by a friend that was published in this magazine, ""Retro Review."" Nylon, June 1983 ""I don't play it and I hate it, just like a mate of mine that is also not a big fan. I thought it was corny",1

31, I have seen this movie and even though I kind of knew who the killer was from the beginning I still liked watching it. I would recommend it to other people. It comes on Lifetime movie network quite a lot. And I am thinking since it's close to Halloween they might play it more. So please be on the look out for it if you are interested in watching it,1
32, I know that I have the same thing here as many of you that are out there. I saw this movie about seven years ago and one reason I saw it was that the movie was being shown on TV and there was a track record of bad films on TV and the only reason I saw this was that it was on a channel that my husband and I used to watch almost,1
33, This is a very predictable and predictable film. The movie starts off with a very neat opening... Except the plot twist. Well there was a twist in the film before that. But what that twist was I don't know... But I am certain that the twist is present. ,1
34," I don't know how anyone could go wrong watching this movie. I don't know if it's good or bad in any way, but at least it's not 'straight up' porn. If you like young teenaged boys playing with sex toys, you may enjoy this movie. As for me, I just love the costumes. And the sexy madness. ",1
35," This was made in 1981, and was a co-production between Fox and MGM. It stars the late John Schlesinger, who he passed to his daughter, Jennifer, in the early '90s. Jennifer was nominated for an Oscar the following year for her role in ""Miami Vice."" A few months before this movie was released, a young actor took the full weight",1
36," I have to say that I found this to be a pretty good movie, especially when you compare it to the following: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />",1
37, I saw this 3 times in theaters... and I have to say I'm not a big fan of this film. It's a kind of serious comedy but I have to admit I kind of liked it. Very strong Henry Rollins in front of an assortment of characters who are trying to make it in this almost Hollywood town. This was a pretty good movie and I'm glad to,1
38, I've seen a few of your trailers and you seem to be very well-pious on this subject but I keep refreshing my memory of it and your trailers are just so clean looking. I have seen some of your trailers and I like the way you have a story line as the heroes begin to dig themselves a new path to success... I think you guys should do your,1
39," I was super intrigued by this movie after seeing it last year's ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" I'm not sure if that's because the movie is so fresh in my mind or just because it really is a really good film... If you're going to see this film, I'd strongly recommend you watch it with your best friend because its not in",1

41," It's a shame that so many American films have been so patronizing about the ability of poor white American girls to get away with their ""insecurities."" THE BIG GUN: Some of the most memorable moments in this movie are the brotherly exchanges between Paddy Considine and Joe Carlin on the train and the first glimpse of the star beside him at the entrance of",1
42," I have always been a sucker for Mel Gibson. But this is simply a top-notch romp. If Mel Gibson's work as a globally dangerous, lunatic law-and-order hero isn't enough, then the same can be said of his other performances. This is one of his best performances to date. It's a little off-kilter at times",1
43, I know this a little bit older than the others. ,1
44," I don't know anyone who has enjoyed the film more than I have, and it's a very moving and worthy visual statement. I thought the actors were great, and the performance by Keanu Reeves as the assassin was excellent. The only problem I found was that it wasn't about murder, although I may just be exaggerating my idea. ",1
45," My latest film, for which I am supporting my pals David L. Adler and Matt Calhoun, is yet another post-modern take on the myth of objectivity. The main characters, played by the esteemed actors of True Grit, can't help but drink wine to their amazement because it's a dry subject that won't lend itself to argument or discussion.",1
46," The first 15 minutes at ten o'clock are, like the time I went to see the ""Halloween"" movie with my girlfriend, a nightmare of a ride. It's about as scary as the movies always are, and I'm not even talking about the worst of the worst. I had to refrain from screaming excessively. It's upsetting to think that I was watching",1
47," I'm not sure that I am wise to even mention this movie. The reason is the way that this short made its way into the rotation of my DVD player is that the majority of its plot is mercifully hidden from view, and in some ways the film could have been a poor version of 'High Noon' if it had not been for the strong performances of some of",1
48," Despite the fact that Tod Vangoontse was, to its best-known present, a film critic, it was a film he wrote. David Lean is a busy man, with a regular schedule of job interviews, press conferences and special events, and a big ego that made him an easy mark for anyone he didn't like. He also had a big ego and",1
49," One of the most fascinating episodes of the series is the one in which a young marriage union is feted by the family and society in the late fifties, not because the couple is particularly good - although it is both - but because a group of heterosexual women are, by a series of coincidences, married and live in the same small town. At the same time",1
50," I never did find this movie very compelling, but I enjoyed watching it. The casting was pretty good, and the story was good. I think there's a certain bit finally happening in this movie. ",1
51," This is a beautiful film that captures the essence of the Pacific Northwest's wild sides and in places is pure cinema. I wish that some of the film's subjects could have written the script that it is best suited to offer, but it was made in the best possible tradition of the genre.<br /><br />I'm one person who is very grateful to this director,",1
52," This is a super looney, yet an unusually brilliant movie and story. The whole thing is too clever for its own good, yet the movie is so masterfully written that it's almost too clever. In particular John Huston's direction is excellent, in that it is so close to the material that the contrast between the two worlds is in the right balance, and it",1
53," I read a review that went something like this: ""I have to admit that I liked the film, especially because it contrasted quite convincingly the poverty and greed of the Nazis and the Establishment, particularly the Jewish one, with the poverty and greed of the townsfolk. You also enjoyed the character development, especially in the first half when the film was about high school students.",1
54," I thought it was a very good movie, although I'm not sure which B-movie I'd recommend it to. This movie has big stories, but I think the movie as a whole could've been better if they'd spent some time focusing on the role of the killers, instead of just one of the characters, and if the movie had been a little more complex,",1
55," I haven't seen this one yet, but I noticed that it was mentioned a few times in a recent entertainment review. I've stopped watching home movies since I was a kid, but since I believe it's a good movie it should work with me at home. It's a good reminder of all the other points in my life that have been wasted or at least neglected.",1
56, It's a shame that the recently-released The Devil Wears Prada has not made its way into my television and/or forgettable-to-the-point DVD collection. This movie is as powerful a movie as any of the now-three boxed sets it was released on. Not only does the picture work well as a dramatic piece of art; it's a,1
57," Saw this movie with my wife and it was a spectacular experience. Let me set the scene. In 1963, the United States was a little behind the curve with regards to progress in the field of health care. That's why there was a public outcry, leading to the passage of the Health Care Act of 1963. A few years later, the Centers for Disease Control came out",1
58," The only reason I am about to talk about this movie is because it's the best thing to come out of June in recent memory. Michael Radford's new film is an honest, believable, and enjoyable update of the famous Shakespearean production, which starred the late Johnny Weissmuller as the jostling Jewish-American businessman Shylock. The whole thing came",1
59," I wish we'd never heard of this film. Christopher Plummer did an excellent job as the notoriously unreliable accuser. I thought he was a little too ahead-of-the-game at first but got the job done. I was also pleased with Sharon Goering as Gertrude, the blond girl who is the confidante of the prosecutor. The part was well",1
60," Stephen King, the author of the hokey horror-comedy, This Is the End, had already written his most famous book in the 1980s, which would become a movie starring Vincent D'Onofrio and Jennifer Lopez. The story of a man falling for a woman who is possessed by a ghost/demon, and subsequently becoming possessed by that possessed woman.",1
61," I would have to say that this isn't that bad. As the new movie of the year, in my mind it's a nice little cliché-fest. Also besides some good old fashioned heartbreak for the characters, there's a lot of angst and pain in the melodrama and it's very good. It's just not as good as the original. I wish",1
62," This is a story of redemption, but it's a story so deep it can't be judged by the standard of its originality or its theatrical presentation. Here we have two men on a mission, one of them a priest and the other a criminal who's had his heart broken long enough, and who's determined to redeem himself by faking his own death to gain the",1
63," This is a movie that has always had the same director as the original and composer of the film, Guy Ritchie that helped create the world of Hollywood, and Roger Ebert for whom this film can be explained. It also started as a different idea for the two lead actresses of the original movie and this one is (in my opinion) very much an attempt to create something",1
64," A young woman is forced into a life on the edge of society, this time on the dark side of the ""drugs"" street, one that is extremely drug-addicted, but that's not the only thing that's going on. What the film does well is not so much the story as the manner in which it tells it. It begins with a woman who",1
65," I saw this one of the best picture ever made. It's very good. A very good movie with beautiful actresses in the lead roles. It also has the whole thing going down in about 2 hours. It's fun to watch, if it don't give you any nightmares. Just go out and see it now. CLICK HERE for the best links and reviews for BLACK S",1
66," Although I am still a big fan of this movie, I find it slightly tiresome, especially in terms of the gay scene. It is one of the better ""underground"" romantic comedies I've ever seen, but since it's so over the top and very sexual, I have grown to think that it is not for everyone, and not for me. I just",1
67," The new movie Back to School is simply filled with a bunch of lame try-hards who can't bring themselves to be real people. The problem is that they aren't real people, either, but more like a bunch of grunts who are jumping around. As a result they find themselves being watched by a few nameless people who are also just grunts. Leave",1
68, Is there anything better than watching the visually stunning rock opera from a theatre screen? as the uplifting and relaxing finale to a gritty period piece. I was all about it. ,1
69," Yeah, I know this is not a very high-brow movie, and I know that most of the viewers will probably be unfamiliar with its history of the era of Death Wish or Mean Girls or Billy Elliot or these kind of movies, but if you like those kind of films you might want to see this. And if you like a hot girl first and foremost, I think",1
70," I am not sure why people object so strongly to films that are so over the top. A film about a prison inmate being forced to rape a beautiful young woman seemed to work out well on HBO, but I guess it's just a matter of loading the plot with as much violence as possible. This was one of those films that just didn't work for me. It was",1
71," I really enjoyed watching this film. In my opinion, I enjoyed Craig's appearance more than his acting. I thought he was very funny and interesting to watch. I think the reason this movie was such a good deal was due to the film's focus on his character. He's not a psycho, but he is a character who is very complicated. He's the sidekick",1
72, The shocking reality of AIDS was practically a physical fact. It didn't take me long to find out that the film was about a man who is at his wit's end with the same thing. I have run across this movie everywhere. The only difference that it is so good I think that I have to see it again and again. <b>I would like to thank,1
73," Didn't think it would be this good. I'm not generally a fan of the actor playing the lead, but that's what's happened here. There's a lot of nudity but not a ton of gore, which is a blessing in this genre. Actually, there are a lot of gore scenes, even more than you would expect from an R-rated film, and",1
74," You know something's missing when you see someone you admire going through a difficult time, but you also know that there's a chance that fellow viewers may not have quite got the picture.<br /><br />But the rest of the time, looking at this film, it's clear that Ford's directorial debut is truely mediocre. If anything, it's a film",1
75," Unfortunately, this film could not be put down. It wasn't long ago that I was convinced that I would never see a live-action remake of Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet, or that I would amass enough film collection to allow me to start watching the movies again. But it seems like a lifetime ago. This latest incarnation of the classic roles of these two characters,",1
76," The movie opens with a literal cannon ball, an exploding bomb, two large trucks, and four people fleeing from a roadside bomb. Almost immediately, the plot follows a certain pattern. We follow the lead character, Billy (Mindy Kaling) and his two best friends, Jay (Rachel McAdams) and Dax (Jared Harris). All the while she is trying",1
77," The director of this movie shot the movie in about four days, for a total of about 15 minutes. It was filmed at the El Cafe in Oyster Bay, N.Y., and the main actors did all their scenes fake, either in makeup or in the flesh. And it's all for a reason and it's not to glorify the subject matter. In fact",1
78," This film is very good. It's not perfect, but it's not exactly bad, either, so it's okay. The story of Veronica makes for great entertainment. The performances are good, the direction is excellent, and the cinematography is one of the best I've seen in awhile. It's entertaining to watch, and the effects are so well-done, you",1
79," When I was a kid, I was fascinated by the television show ""M*A*S*H."" I saw it many times on the screen in the late 70's and early 80's and I loved the show and the way it dealt with the Vietnam and World War II in a very realistic way. But what I liked as a kid, was the way the show",1
80," I'm not very familiar with the movie, but I heard that it's one of the best, if not the best, film ever made about Elvis Presley.<br /><br />It was a very long movie to see, but it got to be pretty good by the end. Not quite as good as another movie, but certainly far from being a bad one.",1
81," I have been watching this movie for a few months now, and I'm just so glad to see that it is finally released . . . It's a great movie with great actors (including Al Pacino) I've never seen before, and I've seen so many movies that were this good but that only showed one side of the character. It's not that I'm",1
82," This movie is a very good picture for that time period. The cinematography is fantastic. The actors are all strong, very good, well-trained actors. The film is a little dated, but there is something to be said for this era. I don't think the cinematography is as good as Reiner's ""Casablanca"" or Spielberg's ""E.",1
83," I haven't seen it yet, but I am very interested in seeing how it will be received by my friends who do. It's not very long (about two hours) and it's certainly a trial for the poor young actors. It was directed by a young director, Remy Descartes, who also directed two of my favorite Hollywood films . . . (from the",1
84," I was going to write a review which might be considered (in its way) a prosaic and assertive one for the subject of this movie, which is all about teenagers and their quest for identity. But just as I was about to let the reader know that this movie is pretty much about the search for sense of personal identity, I thought I would instead make the short",1
85," Actually, it's a good movie. I'm not sure why everybody who saw it felt so strongly about it. All of the actors are good and the story is interesting. But even if you've seen the picture before, it's not a very good movie. It's just not enough to make you want to return to the theater with a full-blown appreciation of the",1
86," It is a must see for anyone who loves silent films and for anyone who loves games. Ristar and the Follies in Paris are the two greatest movies of silent film. And Oscar Wilde always seemed a little bit out of place in The Follies. The first movie, Ristar, is so one-dimensional that you can't take your eyes off of it",1
87," This is a movie that would have made the Oscars had it not been for the fact that the cast of the film include some of the most audacious and powerful actors of our time, Richard Burton, Ron Howard, and Peter Ustinov. While that may be a bit of a letdown, it's also a wonderful achievement of filmmaking, and a wonderful companion",1
88," I've been obsessed for several years with this movie, and have been waiting for the day that this became a direct-to-video franchise. It's been played on TV a couple of times, and I hope that Sony will make a theatrical version. But all I can say is that I wouldn't hesitate to see it again. The film is written by a great story",1
89," I'm not sure why the studio is going to release a sequel to 'High Noon' only a few weeks after the original movie. There is just no substitute for the original, and there's simply no excuse for a sequel on the day of its release. The film was good, but not perfect. The movie has just too many flaws. I haven't even seen the",1
90," What can I say? The movie is a comedy, of course. And I can't remember the last movie I saw with a funny plot AND a really good script. To tell you the truth, I found little redeeming qualities to the film, but that's not to say that there aren't. What's nice about his story, though, is that it's not",1
91," People love to complain about the gross, but the greatest director of the 20TH CENTURY was a French Jewish-American. Certainly, his films were not for everyone, but he remains a very interesting character and an interesting man. I saw this film last night and, with the usual exception of a few blacks, absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the film",1
92," I never really liked the silent background movies. It was hard to keep my eyes off of the camera. I've had a good memory of this one, but I can't remember ever watching it on TV. It's a very good film; it's so good that it's hard to believe that it never happened. I would expect this to be very, very good.",1
93," In many ways it's like the last years of the silent film era. But in this case, the government is being forced to make a film about that era, too. The film begins where it ends. Well-intentioned, not very clever, the film is by far the least enjoyable of the silent films, and in many ways the most disappointing. Hollywood has now",1
94," I was surprised by the success of this movie. I didn't think it would get to the theaters for more than a couple of weeks. Not many people had liked it, and there were some who didn't think I would like it, either. I was right to be cautious and go for the last weekend. Sunday night, I watched it with my wife. It was",1
95," As a result of a serious (and painful) heart condition, it's not really the point of being in a prison where you're not allowed to see what you want to see. It's a movie about a guy who looks kindly at everyone. It's a movie about the fascinating world of American prisons and the people who have to live there. He's also an ex",1
96," The truth is that I saw this on television in '56, and it felt very old to me. But this movie was excellent, and the artistry was amazing. It's clear that this was a fascinating tale, and the true romantic story is very involved. The movie is pretty (for its time) and very, very beautiful. The actors are superb, and the",1
97," The screenplay for ""High Noon"" is as good as it gets. Director Michelangelo Antonioni was a brilliant filmmaker in his own right, and his credit as a genius is greatly deserved. He understands the necessity of irony and how to treat the audience's expectations to the maximum. But, too, this movie is an interesting mix. Antonioni has given us a",1
98," The movie is about a young man, written and directed by the legendary Michael Radford, who writes and directs himself. The scene in which he learns to play the violin is remarkably well done (it was all improvised, but it's a deep and impressive performance). The movie is badly edited, and the music is badly acted and rendered. It's all pretty boring, with",1
99," This was as much a love letter to the movie's other strong points as it was an homage to the two directors responsible for the film's creation. But it certainly didn't have the high production values of the Hammer years. It's definitely a good film, but I wouldn't call it a classic. The young actors that appeared in the film were all over the place and",1
100," This film was very interesting. The story was simple but it is a very scary movie.We also get a look at the life of an Algerian woman named Saeida who is a collector and sells interesting things to people. We also get to see the life of one of her friends and her family, who she bought a house for, who she killed and then whoever",1
101, I am a big fan of young actresses and I love this movie for its beautiful costumes and the way it surprised me with the love of the young woman. It is a nice movie but it is not really a romantic movie. It is a mystery movie but I didn't mind it. I think that the movie could have been a bit better but I thought it was a nice,1
102, I really liked this movie. I am a fan of Mary Roach and I thought it would be fun to see a divorce lawyer be in a comedy. Mary Roach is amazing. I laughed out loud in about every scene. I am so happy with this release. Oh HOW I APPRECIATE the kids getting to see this in theaters! I promise not to make,1
103," I liked the movie. Not the best movie, but it was very good nonetheless. A lot of actors did well this movie. Laurence Fishburne he was the best actor you could expect in a holiday movie. He was so well put together. What a wonderful role he played. I liked the rest of the actors a lot too. The rest of the actors were",1
104," This movie has a lot in common with that other movie called ""Double Strings."" Another lesser known movie in that other movie's style. In this movie the people backstab each other instead of going after the bad guys. The thing that adds to the movie is the music. I replayed this movie on repeat a few times. I love the music and it's really",1
105," I was so excited to see this recently, I have no complaints. Ewan McGregor is fantastic as the main character (and as much as I dislike him in this movie as I dislike him in the previous two movies). I don't want to give away any spoilers, but I think that there are some scenes that could have been better edited out. Which would have made a",1
106, This is one of my favorite shows on TV. If you are not familiar with it. You can watch it on Lifetime At least once a week. ,1
107," I'm not sure if it's a good movie or not for some reason, but I still liked the movie. It's a bit of a dated movie but it's also very well done. The movie starts with the s/m scene, mainly the girl spends her time with the guy's father while the dad is away to work, so when she gets back to her",1
108," I've been a huge fan of Jennifer Lopez. She has to be one of the most famous of the 80s. And I was so amazed at how well she played this role. I was really expecting a lot from this movie. I was expecting a big star turn and a little bit of a role-reversal, but no such luck. Really what the stars",1
109, This is a good watch. If you like Riley Robinson and all the other talented actresses that are in this movie she is the one to watch. The movie has a good plot and one of the best ending ever. Even though I am not a fan of old movies especially those that are black and white you can see how this movie is a work of art here. But I,1
110," I watched this movie on Lifetime recently and I think it's great. It's the most realistic movie I've ever seen. The storyline isn't too crazy, and I'm very happy because I think if people watched it and thought it was realistic they would be awesome. I think any director should know that just because it's realistic it doesn't mean that it's true.",1
111," I have seen this movie every summer since it aired. I was a librarian in college and yeah, I liked it but I found it very lacking in the way that other people loved it. To be perfectly honest with you, I think the entire movie is a waste of time. I don't think that it's that bad actually. If you like movies that are """,1
112," I immediately loved this movie. I had an older brother, and I watched this movie when I was 2 years old. I wanted to see this movie when I was a little older. I really enjoyed the movie. It's light hearted and funny and the characters are well rounded. I would recommend this movie. ",1
113," I really enjoyed reading about the plot. It was really surprising, coming from a male perspective. ",1
114," Very strange, alot of the scenes turned out to be so good! I did like the plot and the little twists. I think the audience will be caught up with the story in a new way. The story is simple; a woman is murdered and the only person who finds it's body is her boyfriend. If you like these kind of nasty scarves, I recommend to",1
115," This is a fun movie and I love to watch the ""kid actors"" of this moment in time. I also like the music, the costumes and the scenery. It's very strange and psychedelic, I'm not sure if I've ever seen a more surreal kind of movie. I thought about the storyline a lot as well, but I'll let you see it for yourself",1
116, I am going to let you figure out what I think about this movie. I really liked it. There's something about the movie that makes me feel good. Especially in the first ten minutes or so. I've never seen a movie in which the main character is shown to control someone else and then at the end of the movie that character is on her own and gets shot,1
117, What's up with all the haunted V.I.P.s? I loved it! I did not realize there was a style for Halloween until this movie came out. It really does look like Halloween and not in a bad way but in a unique way. This movie is about two young people who become friends. The movie has a great message about loving and being loved,1
118," I have seen this film and I thought it was okay. But I didn't mind much. The acting was okay, but the movie was very slow to start and it wasn't like watching a romantic comedy. The scene where Avril and Kevin kiss was meh and unnecessary. I was hoping for a bit more action, but it never happened. I think it's because",1
119," I'm questioning about why I had to watch this film. I have seen the trailer and thought it was okay. We were watching a loose, not condusive with a very well-done celebration of everything that is modern. The acting, now I must mention it was superb. Very likeable characters and very socializing scenes and a very good plot. But what I didn",1
120," I like it a lot. The movie is about a man who found it difficult to live without his wife, and it makes the world a better place. His wife was born with a name forbidden to mankind, she was happy being with him, but a year after the birth of their daughter, the baby was sick. She went to the hospital and they tried to treat her",1
121," I've seen it around a dozen times now, but this is the first I've seen the film. The whole thing has a lot of heart, the kind of heart that needs to be given some bloodless treatment. It has a case of ""Be careful what you wish for"". Though there are plenty of good musical numbers, the film seems to be about one man's",1
122," I was initially attracted to the film when I saw the trailer. It had a nice romance and the love interest was beautiful. The only thing I could see wrong with it was the concept of the film. I don't agree with the premise of the film, but I thought it was a good start. The film is full of good performances, and sweet, sweet moments.",1
123, I would have liked to see a little more of the real people rather than the only source material of an all-star cast. I think it would have been a better show if it was as well done as the rest of the film. ,1
124," There is just something about this actor that makes him so appealing for his character in this film. He is so completely in character, he makes his character completely relatable. His dialogue is better than most actors's, his acting is better than most actors's, his scenes with Michael Caine are better than most scenes with Michael Caine, his character has a more human portrayal",1
125," The only thing worse than having the director/writer/star of a film decide to make a one-time tryst after a film has been made is to keep doing it.

127," When I saw this film, I thought I only saw movie clips. I don't remember what I thought of the acting or the directing, though I do recall that both were believable. However, the film is a mosaic of a number of different and interesting characters. At the beginning of his career as a musical comedy actor, Cora Jean Blythe was a very convincing",1
128," Wow . . . I was almost surprised. Wasn't that a shame there were not more films about this type of historical event? It's a neat story, pretty well shot, and a pretty good picture. They really did an excellent job. ",1
129," It is the best movie on acting I have ever seen. All the artists are old Turkish theater actors, they are magnificent in this movie. It is sometimes said that ""They do not act, they live it,"" you can really see this in this movie. The director is also competent, you cannot see lots of moving cameras around but the positions of the cameras are also good",1
130," A fool is a fool is an attempt to depict a foolish person. That has to be made plain, and obviously, that is not the place to do it. The problem in this case is that the fool he's speaking to is someone else, not the person the fool is talking to. It is like opening a booby-trapped box, where the contents are",1
131," A good movie, with lots of size ",1
132," I love this movie, I really did. Not only is it dark and twisted, but it is also violent and cruel at the same time. There is also lots of wonderful, real-life drama, which you don't see in a lot of films. ",1
133," I enjoyed the film and most of the actors. Their appeal as I'm sure everyone can tell from looking at the above pictures is really, really big. But it is a story so big that it needs a short to up the ante. I did enjoy the film, but watching the actors give it up so easily seems a little too easy for them. You can tell that",1

This is a film that touches on some very sensitive issues. In an effort to goad the United States into war, our evil, greedy, profligate emperors summon a man, Rabbi Akiva, to the king's court.

136, It would be since I've seen this movie that I have ever been so happy. But that is not the case. The great thing about this movie is that it is not about the great Shylock who suffered and died under the heel of the Jewish enemy. The film is about the man who left his home and his birth parents and who turns to the Jews as a,1
137," This is a really good production. I did not use to be so into it. The story is about a guy named Vinny. He left his family to follow his dreams.

The Coenz Brothers are great for the first time they have done a theme song, I know that the music is a little cheesy but it quite a lot of fun to listen to it. Its a shame that this",1
139," The best film I have ever seen, I recommend to everybody. I was so disappointed when I saw that the director was so arrogant and pretentious that he thought his movie was as good as any of the other movies he made. He had to charm me by telling me that his movie was better than all the other movies I saw. I found that funny, and it also",1
140," Good sirs and august ladies. I'm not sure why the director chose to cast John Ritter as the villain in a mystery film set in a mansion. Granted, Ritter looks like he could be a little more wriggly in the puzzles he's putting together, but I like the concept of the mansion and I'm a huge fan of Ritter's work",1
141," One thing that has always annoyed me about ""Harry Potter"" is all the jokes that they took from ""The Lord of the Rings"" (and I think even from ""Harry Potter""), the films use of fantasy and rightness thinking, it is just ""irrelevant"" to the point that I can't stand it. I suppose it's really fun to think that you can",1
142," I was just happy that the camera crew changed rooms from the set to the bedroom. First of all, the final, intense scene with Kelly Costello and Marius Caen was very cool, especially because it was filmed in a bedroom! I liked the ending, although it was a little underwhelming.<br /><br />What was more interesting though was some of the",1
143," The flick was a real low point for me the entire time I saw it, it was just so bad. I don't think it can ever get a rating because it's so bad, especially since the film is so short.

Not to mention the great lines like "" your head is too small for my cock"". The lighting (especially the sun) is phenomenal, and the storm scene was awesome. ",1
146, The show was very funny. I liked that it had a serious depiction of father-son relationships. THE CUTS are all so effective. I was glad they did the scene with the movie star's girlfriends in the finale in the movie. I also liked the way it was shot. I thought it was a good scene to finish with the shipwreck. I thought the,1
147," The remake is even better looking than the original, including gorgeous new sets and costumes, new locations and a wonderful score. Ozzy Osbourne has gone from the Beast from the East to a bigger role! Grianne Stiles has become one of my favorite actresses ever. I really liked her in the original, and I think she is one of the best performers around.",1
148," I really liked this movie as the ""intellectual"" character played by David Spade is not so dumb and silly after all.

I was kinda expecting the same thing, but the",1

307, I saw the original production of this movie in the late 70s with Anthony John Colman. The original production brought the tragic story of a man stuck in a life-or-death situation and how he deals with it. The story is fantastic and the actors of the original production are almost the best I have seen. Colman and Brannagh really pull off the role,1

I thought the cast was great. Brandon, Martin, Elizabeth, even Colin Farrell. It was a real ""I'll bet you can"" movie. Well worth seeing.",1
312," Thought I would never find a film as good as this, but I was quite pleasantly surprised. The film was a huge hit with critics in Europe, where it played for approximately four hours at the Cannes Film Festival. It's at the very least a great movie to watch, and I plan upon re-watching it several times. I have never seen a film as horribly over",1
313," I love this film and I love Donald Sutherland. It's more than the sum of its parts. It's a great drama about life, love, death and the way we must live our lives if we are to be human.

It has some charm and drama",1

This is the role that he is to play, but it is also the role of a character that he is to be in life. The problem is that he can't live up to his performance. The role is too important",1

This is a film that will keep me captivated for a while.<br /><br />The film itself, is a little slower than I expected",1
323," If you want to talk about the future of American comedy and satire, give this film a listen. Though directed by a comic whose charm and charisma are easily rivaled by none other than Leno and Letterman, this film has a decidedly modern emphasis to its characterization, atmosphere and plot. And in its frequent reference to the early McCarthyism of the 1950's (in the",1

One of my favorite movies of all time. I always have my popcorn in hand when Sybil comes in the door. It's a great film. I was sad",1

I never thought it would live up to its potential. I was",1

344," This was a wonderful exercise in editing. It is a very entertaining movie to watch, especially on TV, but one is so distracted by the theatricality of the film that the story itself is no more than a brief diversion. I was very impressed by the apparently low budget of the film, and by how smoothly the film was handled. What a great job by the director,",1

It's about two orphans, one of whom falls foul of the institutional system and is executed by an American army officer.

1," ""Rocketship X-M"" is an unmitigated disaster. Aside from some boring action scenes, the movie itself is so good that it should be skipped due to the conclusion being too uninspired to sustain a movie. Very poor MST3K film.

36," I've always loved MST productions since watching them as a kid, and this one is a definite classic. I wouldn't mind revisiting it again, although the crowd scenes have been gone through several times. The good music and performances go well with this, but I am surprised and disappointed in the movie as a whole. It's a very well-directed, somewhat interesting",0
37," A vacationing couple sets out to find a cavern lake in the American West to build a nuclear bomb. Unfortunately the lake is dry, so they have to paddle across a frozen river to explore the unexplored caverns, only to find it to be a giant Shangri-La. The picturesque riverside scenery is great and all, but the script makes a mockery of",0
38," This is a rather simple story, without the time or space to explore it in depth. It doesn't say much, and its strength is in its portrayal of the real life events; it shows them realistically, and for that reason it can appeal to many viewers. I have seen this film many times, and I always look forward to seeing the next movie because of the fantastic",0
39," This was enough to make me laugh especially when it came to the actual plot, but its an average hit for the most part. The story, while engaging enough, is really bad and there's not that much plot. The most eye-opening moment for me was when the aliens abduct the boys from the spaceship, and you realize that they're abducting kids too- this",0
40," I am often scathing in regards to how MST3K series has become one of the worst in the history of television. I've seen the shows accept this NUCLEAR bomb the same way they accepted the ""Metalhead"" and ""THOR"" trash. I think they are in a class by themselves, but they are not only a good program, they are",0
41," while this movie was a bit of an oddity in that it was a science fiction movie, it also was not conventionally a sci fi movie. It has a very special kind of sci fi that is not found in the mainstream film. This movie was focused on a girl played by Clara Bryant that travelled in a spaceship to a planet with a secret technology that could bring humans",0
42," I absolutely luv this movie and luv the actors that played the roles of Scarlett, Br'er Watson and the narrator. I think the story was interesting and it was very interesting to see the story and I liked the way the director made it and the story good enough to put a movie on it's own. I didn't like the way the movie ended. I",0
43," The reason this film feels like it's on the cutting edge is because there is no story to the story, and there is no story to the story. But I do feel it's a bit insipiring.

45, What a simple way to make out a film. I saw this on Cd 2 and I thought it was pretty good. I liked the simple and obvious home-made-off-the-shelf-scenery of the planet Mars. I thought it was nice that the movie featured some of the most famous space scenes of all time too. The best was when the,0
46," I'll admit that I was dubious to see this film in the theaters. It looked like a science fiction film with boats and alien ships, and I wasn't actually expecting a science fiction film at all. I was more expecting something more like a movie that I'd seen in a video store or something. However I was pleasantly surprised when I went in to see this. I",0
47, to sum it up i thought the movie was bad but i thought that they wanted too much fan-service so they forced the viewer into a world they didn't want to be a part of. they just wanted to say what was going to happen and make it seem as if it was real instead of just a good story. So the whole movie is a bit of a waste,0
48," This movie is one of the most ridiculous movies ever made. First off, the cast was terrible. They were poor actors that were thick asNOTHING. Second, the movie was so bad that it basically meant that it was a waste of time to go to see the movie. Now that you know i'm not comparing this movie to other movies that have a lot of",0
49, I rutally liked the sci-fi by the time I saw it but I think it was accidentally dragged into the sci-fi trap by a bunch of humans. I'd rather stay away from any of the sci-fi this movie should be from the beginning. The plot was boring and pointless and really confusing as you see intergalactic starships do things to each,0
50, I liked the picture it was a nice look at the early days of the rocket ship. It was also very funny and I liked the whole idea of the film. I really liked it. ,0
51," This movie what i'd say is a decent movie that's actually pretty good, because it has the whole concept of the atomic bomb coming about but not as it was described in the movie. It has the same story but it's a different story, but i guess it wouldn't have been able to be aired last year because it was a lot of factors that made this movie",0
52," As I begin describing the plot of this comedy, I feel that I should be careful what I say. This film doesn't deserve to be described as a comedy at all. It is a science fiction film.

54," I think it's a good thing that there are a lot of films that are a bit more adventurous and adventurous than usual. I think that's a good thing because there are a lot of people who want to see these movies rather than the norm where they're just either silly, lame, or dumb. I think the reason why there are a lot of bad movies like this",0
55," I was really looking forward to this film because I was a fan and have seen it before on TV where the part played by the actors was really good. But, it wasn't really any better than the TV version it was just a cheap jumbled mess.

I was so disappointed by the direction of the movie it was such shock that everyone was loving",0
57, The cast was actually one good. But the director and the writers were a bunch of total stupid geeks who made a flick amount of trash.

58," Well, the script is decent and the telly style is great. The actors kill it and the story is interesting. With the special effects it is something you can't help watching.

I was shocked to find out that Charlains actually had a lot of talent and that he could have made any movie that",0
60," Although I was not sure what to expect from this one, I was pleasantly surprised. This film is about the creation of a musical opera of 23 works by two artists that were supposed to be used. As the film progresses the various artists are given varying character traits, making this film seem to be about three artists, one beloved, one hated, one loved. I liked this",0
61," This movie is a crazy joke. Sure, it is an original motion picture. But come to think of it, its a movie that the average person would enjoy. The cinematography, the acting, the fact that the movie depicts a true life event of a man, Brian Boxlett of London, who became Scotland's first known serial killer, all this out of the blue",0

Marion manages to get his fingerprints and takes it to the police and when the identity is confirmed that it was in fact her brother Brian he and Bob leave for New York",0
63," This is a great little film by the Italian director. It is a play on the films a Rembrandt and The Last of the Mohicans. It is about the search to find the missing son of a famous Hollywood director. The arghhh! This movie gets way too long, but the story was good and the actors were well developed. I liked the storyline of",0
64," I was not aware this film was made at the same time as was the movie of the same name produced by George Lucas. It is the story of a CIA agent who goes undercover to find out the identity of a september 11th plotter. The plot itself is good, with an abundance of action and suspense. The film is not always as gripping as it should",0
65," Don't see this movie, just rent it and check it out! It is a total rip off and I barely say the words it. It's very boring and talky, and I hate to say it, but the casting of the main characters is atrocious. The movie is very expensive and I plan on going back and watching it for something more interesting! REVIEW",0
66," This movie has an interesting premise, the battle of the five boroughs which has been happening in New York City since the 1900s. It is set in the 1960s, when the young John F. Kennedy is running for president, and he is staying in the great city to speak with the Jewish elite. ",0
67, I was thoroughly enjoying this subtle comedy when I saw it. I thought it would be interesting to watch someone who was not exactly the best of friends. I had no idea what this movie was all about at all. I thought it was about a man dragged from his family home by a sea of suitcases and being forced to build up a life of his own. The kind,0
68," Didn't get a hold of this one. I didn't think it would be bad, I didn't think it'd be that bad. I went to see this movie with my friend Milton.

69, I've been watching this movie for like a year and i really enjoy it. I think there is a lot of potential in this movie if the film executives take the time to give it some care. It's a good movie and when it comes time to cut the crap about it i still enjoy it. The script is very good and the performances are all good. The one,0
70," I was expecting something special out of this film, but I was equally disappointed. The plot is a bit convoluted, but there is enough suspense to keep you interested and tearing through the film like it was a old rickertry or a movie of the 60s. It's hard to say what the problem is, but I just can't see that it is acting,",0
71," This is a very good movie. It's not a bad movie. The acting is great, the story is great, and the editing is great. The only thing thats not quite okay is how all the characters are put together. They are all kind of a plot point. I just wish they had taken more time and given us more insight into each character.

76, This is the best movie i have seen in a long time. The director is so good that you will not notice that there is an overused character. The acting is great and the story isn't boring.

80," I know what I'm talking about. The movie is poorly written, badly directed, and deeply unfunny. The only thing that Rick Heinrich does in the film is to display a kind of suspenseful mystery that never really resolves itself.

82," I'm not a fan of science fiction movies. I'm past the point where I can say that I would recommend a film as a cerebral spectacle to anyone. There is rarely a good reason to see a film made in a certain medium. More often than not it's obvious that the director has some other intent. I thought that ""Rocketship X-M"" was",0
83," The best part of the movie for me was the robots. I had seen the movie in theaters a couple of weeks ago and was intrigued. I decided it wasn't wasted my time. They did a lot of work to make them look real. I was always surprised at the fact that the robots were literally attached to the TV. Also, there was a scene where the robots",0
84," I can't really remember much about the story; in fact it was more of a sketch and sketch straight from the MST3K DVD. It's still a very good sketch, but you'd be hard pressed to say it was anything more than that.

Unfortunately, the humans are now outnumbered and they",0
92," At first glance, I thought this movie would be a decent sci-fi drama. Having seen it several times, the first thing I noticed was the lack of a theme song.
