" RENT THIS MOVIE ON VOD Today is the 45th day after ""Best of MST3K"" . . . and it is another one of the mst3k movies that i feel is the worst movie in the mst3k line-up. 10.0/10

" I'd like to tell you that this movie was good because Joel is soooooooooooo cute and there's such a huge variety of characters. But I don't care. I only watch this movie because the host and the robots are so little. They're cute enough and their voices are OK, but the characters are so overused that they're like a cartoon. I can",0
" an eeeew!<br /><br />The majority of the actors in this movie are either bald, white, or have horrible accents. There are some good actors in this movie, such as Dr. Jones and the kid in the wheelchair. But other than the two or three notable actors, you'll be left wondering if it's real or not. The worst",0
 My friend and i decided to rent this movie. My friends and i thought we would watch it with him. I went to his house and he watched it with us. I thought we would have a good time. Well we had a blast. I was really laughing at the whole thing. The movie was so horrible it was funny. I hope they never release the movie on,0
" To call ""Rocketship X-M"" a science fiction classic is due more than it's release date, its savvy ability to capitalize on the publicity for ""Destination Moon"", and the appearance of actors who would later star in television as Mike Nelson, Rockford's dad and Wyatt Earp.<br /><br />The movie itself is bad enough to be good",0
" Director Harold Ramis is a director that has done so much in his lifetime that even he was surprised at the sheer amount of life he infiltrated in this movie.<br /><br />The villains are the worst part of the movie. While they are so dumb and so bad that they are so bad that you want to kill them, but then the underlying problem is so bad",0
 Is there any kind of plot to this movie? Not much. Is it worth watching for me? No. It is a silly fantasy movie. A good way to learn about science fiction. Even the retarded fans can enjoy this movie. So just rent it and enjoy it.,0
" I thought the first 3 minutes were the best in the movie. The movie was very funny, really ground shaking, and I thought the ending was strange. I am so glad the movie ended on a high note. ",0
" The opening credits and a greeting scene give you a good idea of the film. Looks pretty good. The story is really just a conveyance of a group of people who meet on a remote island, where they are met by a strange bird. This is supposed to be the last movie of Rex Tyler, so the story is OK. But afterwards, everyone is kidnapped and killed",0
 This movie is garbage. This movie is not worth the rental cost. It is horrible. The best movie i have seen in a long time. Watch it with a friend. ,0
 To call this a movie is 100% true. To say this is a conservative piece of comedy is an insult to the intelligence of anyone who has been paying attention very carefully. Adult humor is in short supply in this movie. ,0
" ive seen many movies full of technology in a classic weirde one like mtv/cbs sf. but this, the last one i will mention, is an industrialized version of that schmuck in the orgy. It was released in 1950 and was directed by Terry: wade and joe. it's a science fiction movie and its by the",0
" ive seen the movie 15 times on interwebs and every time it was a blast. i loved it and anyone who has seen the movie, i would recomend you go watch it. Because it is the worst movie i have ever seen. It is the worst film ever made by mst3k and it is not even 5 minutes long.",0
" This movie is a total rip-off of ""He's Just Not That Into You"". The story is the same, the characters are the same, the storyline is the same. It is a hollow, trite, and boring rip-off of any movie or television show you might have heard of. We all know this. The whole thing just looks like a rip off",0
" We're just going to leave it at this. Don't waste your time with this movie. But if you want to chill out on your bathroom floor, this movie is not to be missed. <br /> ",0
 (the finest) I took a few friends and rented this movie tonight. Our friend fell asleep and he was being called upon to explain to us his thoughts about the movie. This is the greatest movie i've ever seen. I highly recommend this movie. ,0
 this movie was a good plot line and a good looking movie so i would recommend it to my friends or say Halloween night and i wouldnt say that i was bored NO! this movie is not for those interested in sci-fi. but it i just wish people would watch it. we can just grow to like it or find it boring. a few of us did and,0
" The plot. the plot. the plot. the plot. The movie: Two boys playing Beethoven in a. What? Now we know. There is a spaceship in the background. One of the boys says, ""Hey there, I'm a rocket scientist and there's a spaceship in the background. Okay, I'll play it."" They build a rocket and a",0
" ★★★★☆<br /><br />I don't see how this movie can be considered a real classic. It is still action, it is the same basic story as ""Rocketship X-M"", and it is still a classic that shows how out of control the original Star Trek was. I can't fault the film either way, except that it is",0
 This is the worst movie ive ever seen. And i have seen lots of movies. Me and my friends rented this one a wendsday evening. Man we had lots of fun. This movie is the worst most boring crap ive ever seen. But it makes you laugh! U will lay on the floor rolling around tryin to get some air. You wonder why,0
" The movie begins with the discovery of the ship in orbit of a planet called ""Sun"" in a story of fate, possibility, and mystery. The ship’s unique technology, and the discovery of another civilization still on Earth, are a clue that it is the “Star Fleet,” a group of interstellar warships sent by the Federation to protect Earth from inv",0
" First, the story is rather ridiculous. More specifically, it is a tribute to Nicklaus' ""Rocketship"" series, which inspired this movie. It's all a bit ridiculous as far as the story goes. But John Carradine, the ship's captain, has a tough job in shoot-out with the X-men when he's in the ship's",0
" This movie consists of the man's refusal to cooperate with his kidnapper, the lawyers that try to prosecute the man, his lawyers, the FBI, and the CIA. Then there is a section for which I don't know much about the plot -- something about a missing spaceship, the possibility of an alien invasion, and a villain who wants to destroy earth with the help of",0
" The story, while definitely entertaining, has a couple of issues. The main issue is the plotting. The biggest prime-time story of the last 50 years, ""Rocketship X-M"" was not handled in any way that could have made it a significant hit. The first thing the boss guy did was begin by telling us how he was going to make us feel",0
" Russell (Don Cyd) is a.k.a. ""Lord Heavyshoot"". After trying to hypnotize a young guy, he and his friend, Jimmie (Jeff Jorvis), join a group called ""The Red Ship"" to do an experiment that will use lasers to hack into a hyperspace station on board a space ship, which will",0
" ""Rocketship X-M"" is a pure job for the production companies/distributors who are still trying to make a go of it after the disastrous ""Earthling"". A group of people with Zentraedi DNA and weapons who attempt to abduct an American woman named Kitty Pryde and alter her personality through programming. The movie gets off to a bad start",0
 Even the briefest character descriptions will make it clear that the film is about two men searching for a ship that was disabled in a collision of a rocket ship and a high-speed airplane. The notion of the movie is that the two men find themselves at the end of the world and are forced to kill each other in the end pursuit. The first sign of this is that,0
" A group of criminals and crew have their own master plan to manage the flow of information through the computer-based transportation system. When their plan is almost fully deployed, they'll be stranded on an island and die of dehydration. Knowing they are going to die, the various crew members will attempt to help the very successful plan by rescinding their own ships and stealing their computers.",0
" This movie, written by Rod Serling, was the first science fiction film to receive an award for preservation in the public domain. But the film, from the perspective of an alien, is not really science fiction, but the kind of crap that is sure to make people cringe for whatever reason. It is much like a box-office bomb without much original material. The film",0
" This top-notch sci-fi film has a ridiculous premise: an untold story that never happened in the real world. The star of the picture is the unknown director based on the novel called ""An Unofficial History"". A mysterious ship docks in a remote location and the mysterious man who appears on screen is the captain of the ship. The man, an ""alien""",0
" There are some scenes in ""Rocketship X-M"" that seem to be originally filmed for the MST3K version. ""When the Machines Go to Earth"" and ""The Demon"". The performances from the actors are what made the movie great. So when there are some moments in the ""Earth"" scenes that had been filmed for a television show/movie,",0
" This isn't a bad movie, just disappointing. The story is rather simple. A man (who I have taken to my grave) comes to a little town to win the trust of a mysterious woman. After a few days, he and his ace mechanic chaperone decides to go down to the Russian town of Kanasansk to find out what is going on. There",0
" This movie is just like the 2001 film ""Star Wars."" A young man finds himself in the middle of a bizarre situation, wanting to help a man he sees in a theater. This man is the same man who has just escaped his own prison by flying through space. The movie is based on the Bowery Boys classic, but this version is brought to life by a",0
" The plot, in the best of ways, centers around the kidnapping and escape of a group of space travelers from Earth in a spaceship called ""The Collector."" In familiar territory for many science fiction films, the mission is to protect their shipment of artifacts, and the movie's problem is that it doesn't even remotely address the issue of what exactly are they supposed to protect? This",0
" This film was 100% a disappointment. I mean, this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century: an unknown man takes advantage of the unsuspecting airline industry and GETS AWAY with millions in ransom without hurting anyone or bungling the attempt. With all of this built-in interest, how could anyone make such a lackluster, talk-laden flick of this true",0
" This original 1949 movie follows the exploits of Lieutenant Colonel Robert Ford, a U.S. Air Patrol commander, and his crew of officers and enlisted personnel, as they seek to render assistance to a downed Mercury astronaut on a mission to Mars. While Ford and his men seek to learn more about the timeline and the space program, the Mercury astronauts are attempting to reach Earth. Ford",0
" If you're having trouble with the obvious, this is a classic. The concept is that an alien invents a space station and sends it to Earth to conduct research. The space station is a farce, the sex scene is gross, and the songs are pathetic. This movie is only worth watching to find out what happened to the original host. I find it hard to",0
" This is a story about, wait for it, planet-hopping (or UFO-hopping if you're on the Yacht Club). In the movie, a group of scientists and students goes on a ""mission"" to Jupiter, a planet that has been colonized by aliens. They are asked by the government to take on the task of turning the planet into a",0
" The MST3K movie ""Rocketship X-M"" is a kind of great science fiction movie, but like most movies this entertaining is dull and dull, boring, and boring! The only interesting thing about it is that it is straight out of the old Werner Herzog movie ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" and has a modern twist thrown in.",0
" The interesting plot is that this is the story of a young man's quest to become the first man to cross the Solar System in a spaceship. The launch attempts are to be made on a spaceship called ""Fritz"" which is traveling across the galaxy, arranging for the launch of a rocket called ""O-2"", and launching from a planet called ""Gali"". The",0
" Anyway, I saw this documentary in cinemas, and at least the first 20 minutes was enjoyable. The story made no sense to me, and it was like watching a two-minute movie. I couldn't take my eyes off the main character, who played himself in the film. His character was a professional masochist who had attempted to garner a life with a woman",0
" How many movies have you seen that are so bad that you think it's just a stage play? Well, Dirty Dancing is one of those movies. It stars the wonderful Jennifer Grey, and is some of the worst films I have ever seen. But let's talk some about Dirty Dancing, shall we? It's a film about an insane woman who's too dumb to commit",0
" This is a great British horror film. It starts slow, followed by a good driving thriller and gets very interesting with a good plot. It has a few good shocks in it. Very much liked it. ",0
" This is certainly a great film, and it's very funny. I just wish the film had been a bit more exciting, as a script-writer who has been involved in many international comedy flicks does not often have the opportunity to do a script-writing job that is the fun of having. The plot is typical of a typical comedy flick, with the main character seeking",0
" I am an A-list fan of David Lynch and I have some bad experience with a couple of his taping sites. I have seen several in my area, but not Reno. I have no idea if the movie was there or not, but I was going to see it anyway. when I saw it I was very skeptical, but I still went. I was genuinely",0
" This was a good film. I admit it up front but it was easy to see why someone would go see this film. This film is an object lesson in how to write a story and make a film. In the 90's I saw a film that I was quite amused with, and thought it was good. I remember seeing it in its theatrical run and I remember liking",0
" This is probably one of my least favorite movies I've seen. It's slow, boring and the characters are flat. ",0
" To be honest, I didn't get this film very far. The story line was about a man who took a piece of stolen property, broke into a bank, and then took a ransom of some kind. The bank manager usually has the lead in on a movie. He was forced to go into a dark cellar filled with various items for a ransom. His wife was there",0
" I've not heard from Jackass in a while, so I was a little surprised when I heard that there another one happening. I'm sorry to say that there is no new Jackass movie in the near future, but we all know that if there is anything it'll be another Justin Lin movie because of his awards and his L.A.X. fame. I",0
" Pretty good, I must say. The plot is simple, it's about a poor man on the subject of immigration who gets a job as a deckhand on a cruise ship. He falls in love with a beautiful woman and spends the rest of his miserable life on the boat. The story is very, very good, the characters are well-developed enough that the imagination he",0
" This is the first time I've seen this film in person, and I must say I'm not that impressed. The thing is, although the movie is about a man taking advantage of the imbecile airline industry, the movie fares badly because the film fails to add any substance to the story. The story itself is little more than a bunch of fun, childish hijinks",0
" When me and my GF went to see this film, we didn't know what to expect, however she assured me that it had good reviews. So I went along with it. We got into the cinema and bought tickets and went into the screen. After a while of sitting there waiting for the film to start no one else walked through the door. I was very suspicious as",0
" A great film, there is even more brilliance here than in Memento. But there is one thing that I found very amusing, how the film makes no mention of his subsequent death, which is very curious. The film also shows us how easy it was to get rid of his body by fuel injection into the ship without a trace. While this was a fun twist,",0
" The Black Knight was released in 2000. It was the story of Martin Luther King, Jr. who was a convicted criminal, and his crusade to stop racial discrimination against black people. It also had a controversial civil rights scene with Bobby Kennedy and Marlon Brando from the movie Side Effects. This film is different since it's about a crime spree. In this film King can",0
" I love films that get off my nerves and I have seen quite a few movies that I couldn't care less about. I personally like films that aren't as entertaining as their title might lead the audience to believe they are, but this film is not one of those movies. I'm glad I read the first review, as I find it too good to be true. The",0
" In a time when we can't even find a good sitcom that shows subtitles, the new Teletubbies film is an excellent attempt to bring a little more family humor to the mix. This adorable little show is about three mischievous toddlers who get into mischief one night after they get caught in a bad situation. This gets things started with some cute dialogue and some hilar",0
" The Good: The film has some great scenes, including the helicopter descent, and the two young women. The problem with this film is the direction. It tries to make a western movie out of a film that is supposed to be a western and for the most part fails. I just can't get into it. If this was an episode of ""Dancing with the Stars",0
" I was kind of expecting to ruin this a long time before I saw it. I was kind of disappointed also. When I saw this film, I expected a lot from it. I expected it to be a good film. But, I was a little disappointed. This film was very disjointed. I didn't understand how one person could get so much money from a",0
" Another interesting take on the career of Dorothy Parker. Here's the thing: Dorothy Parker was a brilliant writer, but she was also an extremely bad performer. Most of her best and most memorable days were spent not in front of the mirror, but in front of the camera. She could be hyper-realistic and humorous at the same time. She did not write the words",0
" This is one of those films I know the story of yet, not only did it get stuck in my head but I can't shake it. Fearful of being taken by the sheer lunacy of such an incident, this is what you get, spiritual mumbo jumbo. There are no real dilemmas or answers to the questions. The story is there for the",0
" My boyfriend and I went to see this film together after seeing her movie I think a week before, it's been a year since we saw a film have seen the tag line ""A boy starts a gang war and a girl is in the middle""... WHAT THE FUCK?!? What is wrong with people? A world where they are just portrayed as people who live in totally opposite",0
" When me and my GF went to see this film, we didn't know what to expect, however she assured me that it had good reviews. So I went along with it. We got into the cinema and bought tickets and went into the screen. After a while of sitting there waiting for the film to start no one else walked through the door. I was very suspicious as",0
" After watching the first movie I thought I'd give 3 stars. Was I wrong, I loved the first 2 movies, but with the 3rd film I thought I may have to give it a second chance. I really enjoy the cast of this film. Everyone has a different personality and seem to have been made for each other, I say this as I'm only half way",0
" A man is found suddenly dead on his doorstep, his wife is in shock and the local police are called. We quickly find out that it is not really him and that he died from a heart attack. We realise that the police are not who we think and we head off to the police station to see if they can help. We meet a policeman, who's not really",0
" When me and my GF went to see this film, we didn't know what to expect, however she convinced me that it had good reviews. So I went along with it.

" A must see for anyone that needs a good laugh. A 23 year old couple and their girlfriend decide to see Bob and Marion Boxletter, the film, i think, is based on a book by Tim Curry, and the book is about a couple who decide to come up with an entertaining but unoriginal idea in this world, and with the help of some friends and a",0
" When a mom buys her daughter a pair of cat-eye sunglasses, she decides she needs to try them on since there are a huge number of cat-eye sunglasses on the market. The glasses are actually quite good and she is more than happy to wear them, but she doesn't like wearing them. The story of the movie is quite sad and they just cannot be together",0
" When I was in my early teens, I had never seen The Pink Panther. I vaguely remember reading a review of the film. That was in the 90s, so I didn't realise that maybe it was one of those films for teenagers. Looking back now, I think I was probably just a bit too young and had no idea what to expect. I was very pleasantly",0
" This is the second time I have seen this movie and it was a great experience. I am sure people will be familiar with the film, it's so famous that the movie's in front of millions of people. The film shows amazing qualities of film. The acting was good, but a few actors deserve to grab the award for Best Actor for their roles. They were able",0
" Well this film has a tonne of evil people in it, but what I really like is the fact that it is a horror movie and you have no one to turn to for comfort or safety in your darkest moments. Don't you think that movies like this will ring more true for the horror community? THE RULES OF ROCK 'N ROLL: The Rules of",0
" Good for a comedy on Monday, but I cannot see why I would be drawn to this film on Friday... I mean, you want to know what happens in the first 5 minutes and then you have to sit through the whole film for the rest? ... it's crap, you can see why people have so much trouble with it. I'm not saying it's the worst",0
" One of the things I adore about John Leguizamo is that he can turn out some of the most hilarious and intriguing roles on film. In this film he plays The Agent, a man who organises the assassination of President Carter which might be the greatest film of my time, or maybe anyone's time. He uses the same secret agent persona as the one of James",0
" I have been a huge David Zellner fan since the late 1990's and was saddened to see his death. When I saw this film this time I thought it was going to be the same old David, normal guy, normal life. As I watched I realised how morbidly realistic it was it's a film about a young couple, Paul and Marion, who are ordinary",0
" When you shoot a scene and it comes out black and white its hard to see a correction. People might scream ""lighting"" at you. The way it was done I couldn't see a correction but I don't know how to fix it. At one point the teacher came into the classroom and the teacher said ""If you want to use this picture to teach, you can",0
 I think this is a great film. Bruce Willis who plays the Joker is pretty good and I really liked the way people discussed how the Joker destroyed the world and how he was trying to take over the world. I thought it was a tight script but there were times where it was a little too long. It was good. ,0
" A friend of mine is a huge fan of this film, and although I didn't see the film for fun I re-watched it the weekend before last. I enjoyed it for the comedy and the plot, and it was a good movie. However there were a couple of problems in the film. One, the main bad guy and main love interest are not very funny",0
" When I first saw this film I had a feeling it was going to be a good one. I didn't really care what it was all about as I was only there to see a film and not to cause any drama. This film was perfect. My girlfriend and I were on a roller coaster in Vegas the whole time and it made us laugh, we didn't get any",0
" A documentary about how to kill somebody in order to make money. It starts with a band of workers cutting up a body and turning it into a perfect body suit to sell to the police. They go on to blow their cover and then they go out and trident them in a factory to make him even more powerful. The documentary seems to be all about making money, which",0
" When we found out that this was a Quentin Tarantino film, we were very surprised as we had heard some good things about the director. It was set in LA and was based on a book by Tarantino , ""My Life In Hell"" This new film was a retelling of the original novel but with a different storyline, it was a great adventure for the characters involved",0
" This is a movie I only seem to watch. I watched it with my son and I loved it. I think that the script was perfect.What they did in the first half of the movie was pretty much awesome. First I forgot that Bob and Marion were brothers, and then later added in a completely different character. ",0
 I watched this with no idea what it was about beforehand. I was intrigued for the first whole hour. It was shaping up to be a great thriller. A very talented cast and good dialogue.Then it all fell apart for me at the sight of the first vampire. I couldn't believe my eyes.A great thriller was flushed down the toilet. The rest of the movie,0
 This movie is a masterpiece and the thing I really loved about it was the dialogue! The actors were really talented and the movie was worth it in it's own right. ,0
" So this was a movie about two people who have been through the same thing multiple times. I mean they have both seen the same monster, but a little more. Yes, a movie of a couple trying to find the answers which will lead them to their son being shot by a vampire. Also yes, it was a very enjoyable movie. ",0
 1 star because it was a bad movie - 2 stars because it wasn't good enough to call it a failure... so it ruins all the good things I thought I was going to get out of it... ,0

" The idea was a great mystery and intrigue all wrapped up in a unique, fun, and creepy horror thriller in the vein of ""The Thing"". However, the film's premise is a little bit odd and the way it played out just seemed like it was set up to suck. Very strange, suspenseful, but not scary at all. ",0
" When this movie came out I was skeptical that this would be a good movie. I had heard a lot about it and thought it was too easy to make into a book. I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />It's a blend of horror and suspense, but it can also be a bit creepy sometimes. As the movie progresses the story becomes about what is happening",0
" So she spends time with Bob. She must have felt that her brother was more than she ever imagined. I think she must know that her brother might be someone other than Brian, but we don't really find out until the end. She thinks that Bob might be responsible for her brother's death. We know that she was the one guiding the assassin to her brother, but",0
" So when Bob and Marion Boxletter see a guy at a hotel, Marion believes it is her long lost brother Brian, but when she approaches him he appears to be someone else just with the exact same face. Marion manages to get his fingerprints and takes it to the police and when the identity is confirmed that it was in fact her brother Brian she and Bob leave for New York",0

The first they think is that you are just a newspaper reporter, but then you realize that you have got to know something. So you go to a friend where you try and get information on the crime scene, but nothing",0
" I am a huge fan of the creepy Brothers Grimm.This short film has a lot of blood, gore and melodrama. It's a good quick ride, but not the type that I'd consider to be a full-fledged horror movie. However, this is a great movie to spend an evening with, or to avoid for a time-out. ",0

As the movie progresses it becomes clear that Bob is in fact not the perfect man he appears to be, but he is obsessed with following his sister",0
"

Well, it was very worth the time to watch it, because it was an extremely clever, very well done movie, especially with the acting, which is just superb. I am in love with this movie.This movie is really a fantastic thriller. I think that it is a must see movie for anyone who likes this genre. But above all, it is a",0
 I had no idea this was coming after reading the summary. It just looked promising and that's what I was looking forward to seeing. The first 20 minutes of this flick were very entertaining and I was really enjoying it.They're finally on the way to the real thing and it seems that they've found their way into a firm believer in this world. I think they are,0
" A proper, creepy, high-concept thriller that didn't quite take a good turn, but still maintains the promise of the movie. A touching love story with a killer love story, a journey through time and some unsettling scenes that would definitely be a little disturbing for the minority of people who prefer horror. A strong start to a new series. ",0

 This movie is a great example of a travesty of the production standards in today's television. This movie has a lot of great actors that are unfortunately totally wasted on screen. It's like a two part feature with the first being a trainwreck. I really enjoyed the comedy in this movie. But then it all devolved into a cop show.,0
" I thought it was a very good first feature film. The acting, the direction, the writing, and the style were all excellent. A good first outing. I thought the script was a great idea. The plot was executed well, and I liked how the movie ended. I thought the score was excellent, and it gave off a nice atmosphere. I would recommend this to",0
 A great movie with a good plot. I didn't expect a movie that will make you fall in love with a vampire. ,0
