" The Last Wave is one of those films that I admire more than I actually like. Because I do admire it, very much. I also admire Peter Weir's other film (that I've seen) Fearless, for its brave and unusual vision, and for its courage in dealing with its theme of suicide. But I do not actually like either of those films. I admire",1
" To be honest, I'm not sure what to make of this film. At times I was bored silly, but by others, I think I found it pretty interesting. The film does have one thing going for it: its gorgeous cinematography. I think the visuals are the best thing about the film. ",1
" A wonderful, fresh, and clever action thriller that will take you leave you pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I am sure if you were to ask most men and women who have seen this film they would say that it is a pretty good movie. So what makes it so good? I give it a 9.5 out of 10.<br /><br />In",1
" I have to say that I loved this film. It's one of the most authentic coming-of-age stories I've ever seen. It's very refreshing to see a film about teens that doesn't have all the typical Hollywood teen movie cliches: no cutting, no sex, no drugs, no drinking. The story is very understated and deals with hard things",1
" I must have seen this movie at least eight times, and I still look forward to watching it, as it is one of my favorites, particularly for the beautiful black and white cinematography, the sumptuous score by Maurice Jarre, and the beautiful photography by Jean Tournier. Although the story is often slow moving, and characterizations are not developed as much as",1
" I was lucky enough to see this one on the big screen, and I was blown away! What a terrific movie, and I mean that in every sense of the word. It is the perfect example of how a great movie is made up of all the elements, each working to perfection - acting, direction, cinematography, music, sound, editing, writing, etc.",1
" 'Mum, Dad and a Blonde' is a fun little movie. It's black and white, and as a result, it is rather low budget, but that doesn't bother me too much. In fact, if the budget was any higher, the movie would probably be less enjoyable. It's a lighthearted movie; something to watch over the weekend with your",1
" A topnotch theatre company with a great stage show. Also, the staging of <i>The Vagina Monologues</i> was done incredibly well in the intimate space of the theatre and the play was acted to the hilt. I highly recommend seeing this show! ",1
" Last week while in the midst of watching Henry David Thoreau: A Life by Walter Harding, I realized that the transcendentalists have never had a biopic. While some might argue that Emerson, Alcott, and Thoreau are presently being interpreted by the son of one of our greatest living actors (Woody Allen), I contend that Ralph Fiennes's """,1
" Hands down, one of the best films I've seen in my life. The cinematography was spectacular, and the acting was amazing. I cannot even begin to tell you how excited I was to see a very talented actress with a good head on her shoulders get a movie that clearly showed how talented she truly is. It was not a movie with sappy romance and a happy",1
" I have been a fan of the Blade series since its beginning. The first ""Blade"" movie was released in 1998, 6 years after the character made his first appearance in Marvel Comics. The film starred Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson, and was a huge success, and spawned two sequels: ""Blade II"" in 2002 and ""Blade: Trinity"" in 2004.",1
" A well-conceived movie that moves beyond the political in a psychological manner. And, as an Irvine Welsh fan since his first book, I am pleased to see that he has carved out a niche within the movie industry. This one does not lack for any of the seamy, sordid and often gut-wrenching minutiae that are all part and",1
" This is one of the most intriguing films I have ever seen. I recommend it to anyone who has a more cerebral interest, rather than a visceral one. I'm not sure if it's completely worth the five-dollar rental though, but you might as well give it a try if you're curious. If you have no interest in film, this is not for you.",1
" I had been wondering what the hell all the fuss was about on this film and decided to check it out on DVD (I had no desire to pay the theater price this time around no matter how good the film was). Glad I did because while it is not a great film, it is an excellent one. This is a powerful film that is at times moving and at times",1
" Another less than perfect film by Bottin and the usual suspects. This is a real treat to the eyes, very graphic and special effects-laden. It's an ugly film, as ugliness is the mandate here. In this case it's about the ugliness of all those teenagers who commit suicide. A concept that is a bit hard to digest, but luckily",1
" I'd just like to thank the Academy for including this film in this year's foreign film category. It's an excellent pick! And the price of the DVD is an excellent bargain, too!<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of foreign films in general, but this story of two soldiers in the 1800s, who fall in love, and the",1
" The section on creating the set for the War Room is a priceless insight into the arcane world of Hollywood in the mid-1950s. <br /><br />Murrow made a point of having as many ""real"" people on the show as possible - instead of hiring stars as guest commentators - as he felt that they would have a better sense of what people were really",1
" This show was a real treat for me because it throws together two characters that I've been dying to see together: William Conrad and William Shatner.<br /><br />I've always loved Conrad's voice and Shatner's performance in this incarnation is compelling as always. The show has a nice sort of ""Die Hard on a boat"" feel to it that",1
" Some of the most powerful scenes in the film are between Isabelle Huppert and Olivier Gourmet. They meet when they are both on the run, and their meeting forms the most intense and passionate part of the film. Gourmet is a Belgian artist who has committed an artistic crime against the US. For this crime he risks extradition, the death sentence and/or life",1
" An extremely well-crafted, heartfelt drama about how a woman attempts to deal with the tragic death of her child. In this movie, a small town in Texas is shaken by the murder of a young girl. The girl was killed while trying to prevent her sister from being molested by a local mechanic. The murder brings together the mechanic, his brother/business partner, and",1
" Ah, yes, the droll, wry Brit-com, which went out of style with the last century, is back in full force in this film, a funny, funny little gem that'll have you howling and wiping away the tears from laughing so hard. If you're in the mood for a film with a tiny bit of bite, a pinch of naughty",1
 I have seen this movie and even though I kind of knew who the killer was from the beginning I still liked watching it. I would recommend it to other people. It comes on Lifetime movie network quite a lot. And I am thinking since it's close to Halloween they might play it more. So please be on the look out for it if you are interested in watching it,1
" This movie was enjoyable to watch. The story was a little slow at times, but overall we enjoyed it. It was interesting seeing Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie in a movie where they don't play their usual characters. I liked their chemistry together, in my opinion it seemed like they really had feelings for each other. This was a good movie and a nice change from",1
 When I saw this movie it was the last one I saw in theatres several years ago. But it was a good movie. It kept me interested in what was going to happen. I think that it is geared more towards adults. Because the boy in the movie was a teenage boy. So I think it would be a little different for a younger children. I think that,1
" If ever a potential movie must've sounded like it wouldn't work based on reading the script on paper, it would be this one. Here we have what seemingly looks like a lurid and seedy soft-porn s&m flick, complete with the huge in-theatre poster, depicting a near-naked Christina Ricci chained to none other than Mr.",1
" This movie is by far the best of the series. The story is good, the acting is good, it has some really funny parts, but overall I think the acting is what makes this movie what it is. It is very good.<br />I wouldn't call it a horror, but there is some blood and some gruesome parts. My favorite part is when Ridd",1
" I loved this movie, it is very funny, and I would recommend it to people who don't need an R rating to enjoy a comedy. The writing is clever, the comedy is surprisingly non-stupid, and I think that the entire cast is great. I can't wait to see it again. I am not very familiar with Will Ferrell, but I am",1
 I had no idea what to expect. I went in with no expectations and the film pretty much blew me away. I really connected with this film on a personal level because I too lost my father at a young age.I do not think my own father received such a send off. I think the movie was really well written and directed and the acting was top notch. I,1
" I saw this movie on BBC2 on Sat night. I really enjoyed it even though it was made in 2003. My all time favorite movie is ""The Breakfast Club"" and I have always thought that the actress who played Claire Standish would make a great vampire. So when I saw that this movie had Claire in it I knew I had to give it a watch. I",1
" This movie is an all time favorite of mine. I find it funny, as well. As a matter of fact, I have bought this on DVD, and watch it just about every christmas. I watch it every christmas, and every time I watch it, I laugh. I really dont think there is anything else I can say that will help you decide whether or",1
 I have almost 100 action movies and this is a great one. If you like action then this is one for you. ,1
 This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I really liked it because it has a positive message and also it shows how the characters learn to appreciate each other and themselves. The message is also real because there is always somebody who needs love and to be accepted for who they are. I think that the actors did a great job because they were able to make me feel,1
 While I am not a big musicals lover the score of this movie is so good that I don't mind the fact that this movie is a musical. I know at times musicals can be kinda boring but this one I found very nice. It's about a girl named Meg and her family who becomes strippers when they accidentally discover their talent when Meg's (Miley,1
" This is a great movie. I hope it will be on the tv again soon. And I hope they will add it to their video library. This is really a good movie. I think they should have added more to the story. I haven't seen it since it was first on tv. I believe that this would be a great movie for a new generation, and I",1
" I love this movie. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend it. The script was well written, the acting and special effects were excellent. And the timing was right on, because it's Halloween time. It's about a group of teens that try to jump start their dead friend back to life. The story line is good, and it's a good",1
" Black Snake Moan (R) Samuel L. Jackson, Christina Ricci and Justin Timberlake star in this film that chronicles the friendship that forms between a tormented, hard-living bluesman (Jackson) and the young, religious, and overweight woman (Ricci) he takes in. <br /><br />Director: Craig Brewer<br />Cast",1
" I'm not sure where to start with this movie. It's 15-16 years old, and stars of the day are Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves, but there's also a lot of familiar faces in it. In fact, it's almost like an all-star cast of actors that you might not associate with this movie. This review is fairly short, but",1
" While the new Marmelade movie advertises its ""torture porn"" style, this movie is actually a very deep movie that explores the power of love. The main character goes through quite a deep transformation from beginning to end that shows love can be an overwhelming force. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in a deep and unique love story. ",1
 Excellent movie! It was much better than I expected it to be. I was very moved by it and I thought that the acting was great! Bruce Willis is one of my favorite actors of all time and he did a fantastic job in this film as well. Ivonne Coll is a great actress also and she was wonderful. I am a big fan of both of them and,1
" The story here doesn't so much embody a rip-roaring action adventure that it does answer a question that I've always wondered about: ""What would happen if a group of soldiers are suddenly ""shipped-in"" to a reality where they are no longer in the bodies of their own physical selves."" I first became familiar with this premise with the movie, ""They",1
 I liked this movie a lot. I thought it was VERY well done. I've always been a fan of Robert Duvall and was excited to see him in a different role. I think he was very good in his role. I also was excited to see Val Kilmer in this movie as well. I really liked this movie and I think it's a good one,1
" As always, the great Robert Mitchum delivers with both guns blazing. The action and the drama are balanced in a way that seems effortless. The way the plot unfolds is perfect, the character development is just right, the setting is perfect, the photography and music are superb, and it is a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole way through",1
" ""Teen Wolf"" is a pretty good movie. The appeal is so great that it's been on several VHS releases, as well as a DVD. The movie is funny, and has great acting. But the best attributes of the movie are the physical comedy, and the characters. The character of 'Teen Wolf' is a great character. The name 'Teen Wolf'",1
" Magnificent film with classic black and white, 2-D animation. Some beautiful, haunting, and funny moments. The plot is simple, but the characters are quite well developed. Was a big hit upon its release in 1992. Not for the under-10 crowd because it is fairly long (2 movies). ",1
" I loved this movie. It reminded me of a film I saw on HBO called ""Into the West"". I loved the way the three main characters were able to overcome their past and love each other unconditionally, even though they had all been rejected by others. The acting was great and I would recommend it for older children and adults! ",1
" Once again, I've had to wait for the dvd/vhs release of a film I've seen on cable, so I could watch it again. ""George Wallace"" is the second film I've seen about the controversial former Governor of Alabama, and both are highly recommended. Although I had seen it on cable, my friend had yet to see it and had rented",1
" ""Concho"" is my favorite western, it ranks up there with ""The Magnificent Seven"" and ""The Killers"" from this time period. It's a great cast and I saw it in 1956 when it was released. Another great movie with a great desert setting. The movie has a great cameo by Robert Hyatt who plays the town blacksmith Dan, with",1
" This movie should be rated ""R."" There is more of a sensual, sensuous feel to it than a romantic, sweet one. Michael Caine is fantastic, as always, but I admit that when I first saw this film I couldn't keep my eyes off of Kim Basinger. I thought she was so beautiful, and never thought that I'd ever see",1
" I had the pleasure of viewing ""The Young Philadelphians"" for the first time on television many years ago, and I was deeply impressed by the film's quality. It's one of those movies which is a true classic; its quality has withstood the test of time, and as a result, I believe that many will enjoy it more than ever. I really",1
" Terrific movie... Great photography. And I think it is a true story. It also has some pretty interesting characters. The woman who plays the wife of the lead is one of the best actors I have ever seen. She is also known for her role in The Dresser, a wonderful movie about a scene straight out of King Lear. I think Richard Attenborough and",1
" Wow!!! What a great movie. Al Pacino and Christopher Walken are fantastic in this movie. I love movies about the mob, and this is a great one!! I absolutely love the character of Frank Vincent, he's great!! I can never look at him the same way. Al Pacino and Christopher Walken are great together. This is a wonderful movie. I",1
 I watched this movie on my local cable station. I don't know what it is about this movie but I got hooked by it. I watched it again and again. I almost hate this movie for the fact that I can't get it out of my head and don't want to ever see it again for fear that I will want to see it again. I don't,1
" I just watched this about a month ago and I really really liked it. I thought the acting was supurb and the story was great. It was a great movie. It was an interesting twist and it really had me thinking who the killer was. I would recomend this movie to anyone who likes mystery and suspence movies.

",1
" The first time I saw this movie I felt it was the best movie that I have ever seen. Later I saw this movie again and then I got a little disappointed for it wasn't as good as the first time I saw it. Anyway, it is still a good movie. This movie is about a man that is going to be executed for murder. A miracle happens and",1
" Al Pacino is one of the better actors I have ever seen on film. He is great in this movie and definitely should have been nominated for an Oscar. The plot is pretty good, and a little weird at times. It was really good. I would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of Al Pacino or a fan of unusual movie plots. REVIEW",1
" ""The Killer Inside Me"" is one of the strangest films I've ever seen. It's not exactly a tough guy film like ""Dirty Harry"" or ""Unforgiven"" is a ""noir"" (however loosely one might use that term) thriller about a seemingly benign small town sheriff who is really a sadistic murderer. His girlfriend, no doubt",1
" Al Pacino gives a terrific performance in this film version of Shakespeare's ""The Merchant of Venice."" His portrayal of Shylock, the money lender who lends anti-semitism and vindictiveness to the role, is a tour de force. It is one of his best performances ever, and he is at his best when yelling at the Christians for their treatment of",1
" ""Conquest of Cochise"" (Victor Mature, John Hoyt, Joan Evans, Leo Gordon, Andrew Duggan, James Millican, Robert Armstrong Director: Robert Aldrich) ",1
 I've seen this movie several times and I enjoy it every time I see it. It is a combination of a couple of genres: western and horror. There are some very tense and even scary moments in the film. When this movie first came out in '56 it surprised a lot of people with the graphic violence and horror. When I was a kid in the '60,1
 I saw this movie on TV just a few days ago. It was a good movie. The actor (Johnny Depp) who played the killer did a really good job. The killer liked to snip the heads off of chickens and send the heads to the cops. He also liked to put explosives in the heads and blow them up. He had a sick twisted sense of,1
" I liked the series, it had a good story and good actors. ",1
" I am not going to say anything worth reading about the story line, because it's an old story and anyone can tell you how it's going to end. But I am going to tell you what the story is about and what is good about it, and then comment on the acting, music, and the filming. The story is about a new guy, Tony (Richard",1
" I happened to watch this movie on television recently and I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't want to watch it in the first place but figured I'd give it a try. I have seen Alicia Silverstone in a lot of movies and I was kind of surprised that she was in this one. I like her though... I don't think she's ""one dimensional"" like",1
 I have seen this movie and even though I kind of knew who the killer was from the beginning I still liked watching it. I would recommend it to other people. It comes on Lifetime movie network quite a lot. And I am thinking since it's close to Halloween they might play it more. So please be on the look out for it if you are interested in watching it,1
 I just watched this movie for the first time and it was amazing. I loved it. I liked how they told the story from the murderer's point of view. It was interesting to see the killer's life and the original crimes. I remember watching the news back in the 90's when the murders were happening and they actually interviewed the mother of one of the two boys killed,1
" The best thing about the movie was the script. The plot was well written and I liked all the twists and turns. It was also very eerie and claustrophobic. I figured out the killer pretty early on, but that's not surprising considering how many movies I watch where the killer is right there in plain sight if you pay attention. Since it was on Lifetime I",1

" I never liked this movie, but even then I thought that the story sounded intriguing. The idea that other people's dreams could manifest themselves as a demon in your own world sounded kind of cool. But for some reason, I never really felt into this film. I didn't like the chemistry between the leads. I didn't really like the acting, the dialog, and the",1
" I am a big Jennifer Love Hewitt fan, so I was very excited to see that she was starring in this film. This movie was kind of a mixed bag. On the positive side, the performances were excellent, and I enjoyed the few scenes of comedy. On the negative side, the film was quite violent and gory - not something I'd want to see again",1
" Into the Woods is a movie for grown-ups, but it is also a film that children and adults can enjoy together. The film is about the classic story of Cinderella and the classic story of the Baker's Wife and her children. They are both from the same family. The story begins with a baker and his wife. They have three children, two sons and a daughter",1
" I am a Netflix member and after reading these reviews, I was looking forward to seeing this movie. Unfortunately I had to watch the movie on TBS and it was not in it's entirety...and from the bits I did see I'm really sorry I didn't read these reviews before watching it. I have to admit the one reason I rented it is because I thought it",1
" Not a bad movie at all. The story was believable enough, although a little far fetched at times. The only thing I felt like really letting the movie down was the ending. I won't ruin the ending to the story, but it seemed like it was all very rushed and the reasoning behind it was not well explained at all. This is a movie that should have",1
" Good looking movie in my opinion, with good acting by the main cast. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good mystery story. ",1
" I've watched this movie several times now, and I think now it's time for me to write down a review about this movie. So here it goes. This movie is about a family, (the Dunst family) who, after a tragic accident, goes on vacation to a mysterious lake house. The youngest daughter, Becca (played by Amanda Michalka)",1
" This DVD is wonderful. I bought this for my brother in law for his birthday. He loves this movie and I knew he would only be happy to receive this from me. He watches this movie so frequently I wanted to give him something new, so I gave him this DVD. He had not seen it before. He said it was great. I was glad to see that",1
 I was a little apprehensive about this movie when I saw the trailer for it. I am a huge George Clooney fan and I love him in anything. But the trailer for this movie didn't look that fantastic. So I went into this movie with some apprehension. WRONG!!!! This movie was AWSOME. Not only was George Clooney great but Brad Pitt was as,1
 I recently found this movie on netflix. I love the story and this is a remake of the 1939 classic starring Humphrey Bogart and Gail Russell. This movie was well done and Gershon and Furlan were great together. I would recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys romance and/or drama. I wish it had gotten better ratings. ,1
" I don't know what the heck this is, but there's an excellent chance that this movie will be terrible. But I will watch it anyway because I am a glutton for punishment. It won't be good, but I'll eat my hat if it's not an enjoyable, dumb movie. It looks like the cast really went over the top with the silly parts,",1
" This is my favorite movie. I love this movie, and it helped me to realize that if I care about someone, I must fight for them. It was a really sad movie, but I loved it. It's really well done, and in the end, it almost makes me cry every time I watch it. I love it. ",1
 I don't like this movie because it has too much violence and killing. I don't like the movie because I don't like the people that are in the movie. I think everyone was bad and not good people. I didn't like the movie because it had to many killings in it. The movie is not my cup of tea. I liked the beginning of the movie,1
" I was disappointed with this movie. Although a good concept, it was rushed, and did not give us much depth to the characters. There was no indication that the ""D"" characters had anything to lose. They didn't invest their future in anything. It was as if their future wasn't worth much anyway. I think the storyline as a whole could have been very good",1
" I am a huge fan of the ""Bourne"" franchise, but was worried how this latest film would live up to the other three. I wasn't disappointed! The action scenes are great. The acting is also great, even though I thought Matt Damon's portrayal of Jason Bourne was less impassioned that the previous three films. The story line is great;",1
" This film is on the surface a story about the effects of police brutality on the lives of its perpetrators, but it is about so much more than that. It is about the effects of one man's violence on an entire community, and how that violence affects the lives of everyone involved. ",1
" This is a great collection of short stories; each story stands alone and yet they are all connected by the repeated theme of murder. I found I could not stop reading until I'd finished the book, and my favorite story was the last, ""An Epitaph."" I was left wondering what would happen next - so now I'm on to the next novel by Patricia High",1
" I saw this movie after a series of dramas and comedies, and it was a real joy to take a break with this fantasy movie. This is the first movie by the director Jean-Pierre Jeunet and it is about a little boy who dresses up like a little girl. It is not a masterpiece in any regard but it's a fun movie that can't get",1
" This film, which is the first English-language film by the French director Cedric Klapish (who made a name for himself in 1998 with a film set in the world of classical music, 'Ridicule'), is a very tough film to review. It's a very strong, extremely well-made film, but because of the subject matter, a lot",1
" I saw this movie on a dvd that I had rented and was a little uncertain about renting it because it was about a lesbian relationship. But then again, I don't really have a problem with it and I felt it is a good movie, but it is not a very good movie. It might be something that you want to watch once, but I wouldn't necessarily",1
" If you're looking for an amazingly accurate portrayal of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, you won't find it here. It's in the title: Almost. This is the original story changed one very important detail: Juliet is not a girl but a woman, and Romeo is a man. The movie is set in the modern day, in a small town in the heartland",1
" This is a well made movie with Shakespearian dialogue and lighting effects, a couple of nude scenes, an original story and plot that will make you think. You will be sorry after you've finished watching it because there were no sequels. It should have gotten a few academy awards. I've read comments from people saying they enjoyed the movie but didn't understand it - well",1
" Based on the Jack Ketchum novel The Girl Next Door, which I have read, I believe this is a faithful adaptation of the book. It is not for the squeamish. It is graphic and potentially disturbing. The beginning of the movie, which deals with the family's reaction to Annie's disappearance and the community's response to it, is fairly realistic and emotional",1
" Wow. This is what war is all about. This movie will take you on a journey through Iran/Iraq war. You will see Iraq's army tactic, you will see Iran's army tactic, it's a war like it's never been shown before. The director is an ex-army officer and the movie is very well made. It's based on real-",1
" I look forward to the day when the seed of a great actor is planted, grows, is nurtured into maturity and we eventually have the opportunity to watch the full flowering of a great actor. I think we got to see how an actor matures into a great actor in Pacino's performance as an unhappily married New York City cop. His performance is so layered",1
" A disturbing, dark comedy, not for the faint of heart. Producers should be sued for representing this film as a comedy. (But it is funny in a very dark way.)<br /><br />There are a few scenes that are frighteningly realistic. The violence in this film is over the top and disgusting. The misogyny in this film is over the top",1
" The entire movie is made on the basis of the theme of ""oops, my mom is a serial killer."" So, the story is not based on the fact that a son discovered that his mother is a serial killer, but it is more about how he reacted to the circumstances. A decent story, but the ending is quite predictable (as in all such movies). Most of",1
" Not the best film of the year, but still good. I don't think it will win the Oscar, but I hope it doesn't lose. I have no doubt that this film will be seen for many many years, as it is a classic, a timeless story of love and hate and the struggle to forgive. ",1
" Adapted from the Joseph Conrad novel by Richard Henry Savage, this silent drama was released in 1926, starring Conrad Veidt, Arthur Housman, and Gladys Walton.

" In my humble opinion, this is a wonderful Australian film. I saw it when it was released. It is a story about a half-Aborigine boy who grew up in the Outback. He had a difficult life and it affected him. His father was a cruel man who won't talk to his own son. He chased him away from his home. But",1
" Took me totally by surpise, this love story did. I loved the emerging of the relationship between the two main characters, the circumstances of their meeting, their different approach to life, their differences, and the similarities of their personalities. I was wondering how this great story would unfold, and in the end, I was delighted with this movie. ",1
" There are two sides to the title of The Double Life of Veronique. It could apply to the characters, but more importantly it could apply to the audience. The two women at the heart of the film are both named Veronique. One is young, innocent and unworldly, the other is middle-aged and worldly. One is Polish, one is French.",1
" I love this movie, it is so well done. And the idea of the movie is fantastic. I definitely would recommend this movie.

But then, the doctors and scientists start to use the donated brains to create a virtual",1

" I've never seen a movie with a more surreal and dark outlook on life, nor one that was more beautiful. This movie is directed expertly and the actors are on top of their game here. No one in their right mind would like this movie, but I loved it. It's very re-watchable and it's also interesting to read about the director's intent",1
" A long time ago, I read a book about the Mayan indians. I remember one thing that fascinated me: they all had ""gods"" that were very like themselves. They were people, they were families and they were brothers. They were everything, in a way that we are today. The one that is the most like us, the one that touches us",1
" A very good movie with a very good plot. However, the music is very loud and confuses you when you are trying to use your brain. Moreover, the actors should have made an effort with their English. The girl should have tried to avoid the dialect, for example, she usually uses ""I'm sorry"" instead of ""I apologize"", etc.<br /",1
" A very well made, enjoyable movie that is stylish and wonderfully shot. The story is about a young woman who is engaged to an older man whose brother, the fiancé's father, wants his nephew to wait until he is dead before he marries. The plot is seemingly straightforward with the brother's character being the one who is the last obstacle for the two to be happily",1
 I have been looking for this movie for years and was thrilled to find it here. I remember seeing it on TV as a young girl and was mesmerized. I was surprised that there are so few reviews for this film. I felt that the reviews for this film were unfair. I thought the acting was fine and the storyline was interesting. I felt that the movie should have,1
 Just because you like Shakespeare doesn't mean you have to like this interpretation of it. The acting is good but nothing spectacular. The cinematography on the other hand is beautiful. The film is quite moody and you get a sense of the time. The costumes and sets are very convincing. In fact the only real problem I had with it was the plot. It just didn,1
" I love, love, love this film. This film contains the best and most realistic scene in cinematic history, the opening scene in which Natalie Wood and George Chakiris are having a picnic and she gives him a hamburger and he, without thinking, takes a bite out of it and exclaims, ""This is good!"" The scene is so funny and so typical of young",1

One day when Joe is gone, Laura is planning a surprise for him when she meets a very nice man at a bar who seems to have a great interest in her. Things get complicated when Joe returns earlier",1
 This comeback looks really good and it was well done. I'd like to see more of this series. The cover and the picture are enough to make your mouth water to buy this. ,1
" The movie is a roller coaster ride, fast and furious..nothing slow about this movie. I could not believe some of the scenes i was seeing. Yes some are way to graphic, but the movie is not about that, its more about the idea, and the concept of the movie, that humans can be cloned, and what it means for the genetic future of humanity",1
" Easy to watch and enjoy. This is the kind of movie that when you see it you think 'well, no one has ever done that before', but you are wrong. The story is from a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It was written in 1941 and filmed as ""Bachelor Mother"" in 1934 (starring Ginger Rogers). It was filmed again in 1954",1
" If you've ever had a boss who could ""lead an elephant by the nose,"" then you'll enjoy this movie. It's a comedy with a touch of bitterness, and it's a good introduction to some foreign films that don't have subtitles. It also has an all-star cast that includes Sterling Hayden, Paul Henreid, Richard Conte, Dina Merrill",1
" I'm not sure why everyone is so down on The Bride. There were a few things that bothered me, but the film did not suffer from them. The village setting, while interesting, really had no purpose in the film, and was only used in one scene. The relationship between the bride and groom was rushed, as was the buildup to the wedding. I liked the",1
" I watched this movie for the first time when I was a kid. I believe I was about 8 years old at the time. I was enthralled, and I loved it. Now that I am an adult with kids of my own, I was able to see it again, and I loved it all over again. The musical score by Elmer Bernstein is absolutely the",1
" The film takes place in the days of universal paranoia and insanity that were the days of the Cold War. The cold war period is the time when people were paranoid about communism, and as a result, they were in the search for communists. Every day, newspapers filled with images of communist spies, Soviet missiles being launched, etc. The Cold War was a time when people lived",1
" If you're a fan of the original series, you have to see this film. It's very much like the show, with a few deviations and some new characters.<br /><br />I thought it was a good tribute to the original show and it was entertaining to watch. The story was just a little bit thin and so it didn't have a huge impact.<",1
" I love the songs, I love that everyone has their part and it makes sense. I don't get why people say it has no plot. It does, very logical and well organized. Great job by the writers and actors, you are all wonderful! I can't wait for the director's cut to come out on DVD, my husband and I would love to have it",1
" I was looking for some action pieces for my 9 & 10 year old to watch. Found this movie and it was great! Wonderful story, great characters, really fun to watch. The story was as good if not better than the first. I think some of the younger kids would have trouble following the story line. But if they are interested in action movies, the should love",1
" Now I know why this movie was made by a different cast. The series is still going strong, especially the last 5 years or so. Two things should be done to make the movie work. First, the movie should be made during the timeline of season 4. Second, the movie should be Dr. House, Wilson, and Cuddy only. You could make the Wilson",1
 I do not like this show at all. The sister could have been killed off the first episode. The show is just plain stupid. I give it a ZERO! ,1
" This movie is astonishing in its scope and ambition, and is a very interesting movie, with amazing special effects and a great cast, and a good story, as well as a very original idea.<br /><br />I think this movie is among the greatest of the great. There has not been a lot of movies like this. The story is about a whole colony of",1
" I thought this was a pretty good movie. Not the best of the year but the premise for the film was what made it worthwhile. It's the classic ""bad cop"" trying to take out the bad guy, but with a twist. The main bad guy, Red Mist, was actually a good guy after being struck by lightning and changed into a super-villain.",1
" This was a great movie! The plot was quite interesting, and it held your interest throughtout. I also thought that Denzel Washington did a good job as the main character in the film. He was just a loan shark interrorgating a guy at first, but as he began to find out why he was there, he grew alot. The only thing that",1
 Finely the dolby digital soundtrack sounds good . The only defect is a little bit of noise here and there . One or two brief times you hear some hiss . The audio quality is better than I expected .The soundtrack is exactly as loud as it should be . The producers of the film or the studio could have released a special LD version of this film for serious,1
" It was a very cute movie.As with all these teen-type movies, has too many cheesy moments.But overall-it was great! ",1
" I've seen this movie so many times, and it is still one of my favorites. The acting is superb, the story poignant, the message important. It was a spellbinding experience on my first viewing, and I'm sure the magic of it will return every time I see it again.<br /><br />Great stuff, if you're a fan of documentaries.<",1
" I love this movie. I am a big Al Pacino and Lucy Liu fan. I have seen all her movies. She is a great actress. Al Pacino is a terrific actor. He also has a voice that can make your hair stand on end. The movie has a great story line, with lots of twists and turns. The music is great. A must see",1
" Not having seen the original, I'm still entirely unprepared to say whether this remake offends or not. The new version seems to be a little more explicit than the old version, but I guess that's to be expected. The acting is pretty good, and of course the tech work is top-notch. The only real complaint I could level against this is that it",1
 Anyone who has a brain knows this is another great Batman movie. Having a young Batman in this film makes it more interesting because the viewer gets to see Batman when he is still developing his skills and abilities to fight crime. His sidekick Robin is funny. I think it was cool that he was a computer hacker as well. I like that Batman had a sidekick in this,1
" A very dark movie that will make you think. Although there are elements of humor, the general mood is to make you think about what you would do if someone close to you needed a kidney. After watching this movie I was very glad that I had never gone to the extreme of considering signing up to donate my kidney as the movie had made it appear. I think that the",1
" This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I watched it at least once every week. The story is interesting, funny and heart warming. I love the characters in this movie and can't wait for the next one to see if they become just as great as the first one. I recommend this movie to anyone who is open minded and can handle a little bit of",1
" This mockumentary takes a look at the life of fictional serial killer Ed Gein, his background, the events leading up to his murders, and his eventual capture. Ed Gein is disturbing, that fact that this film is so real makes it all the more terrifying. The film is a wonderful blend of comedy, drama and horror, with a great deal of suspense.",1
 I saw this movie when it came out in the theaters over 17 yrs ago . It was an instant classic I was still living in NY State at the time . I have been a fan of Dan Ackroyd ever since . He has been in so many movies that I have seen over the yrs. This is one of my favorites . Liz Hurley was outstanding in,1
" I NEVER expected that looking at the cover of the DVD I was keeping myself from a masterpiece. This is one of the best DVDs I have in my collection. The price was reasonable and the movie was really good. It is NOT a cheap DVD, so I am very happy to have purchased it. It keeps you in suspense, you never know what is going to happen,",1
 This movie is excellent and very funny. I think that Jack Black is one of the best actors of the year. ,1
" It's not a love story. If you could enjoy ""Dances with Wolves"" then I think this film would not leave you disappointed. <br /><br />We get to meet a group of people who are trying to survive the harsh environment of the Alaskan wilderness. We get to meet the relationships that develop between humans and the natural world. The main character",1
 I saw this movie when I was 12 and I absolutely loved it. Cassie wants to be an evil genie and she does the right things to get the job. Cassie then wishes to be a cheerleader and she is. Sheridan is a junior at her school and Cassandra is her best friend. Cassandra wants to go to prom with him. Sheridan and Cassandra are going,1
" I was a little disappointed by this movie. Not because of the acting or the acting quality, but because I just thought there was something missing. The characters weren't very well developed, and I couldn't tell who was who, and that made it hard to get into the film. The film also had a problem with pacing, as it seemed like it never got going.",1
" My wife and I have a friend who worked on this and he told us it is the only movie he ever worked on that had to be reshot because of the main actor. They had to reshoot several scenes because of the main actor, Tom Arnold, being as intoxicated as he was. He was so drunk he couldn't remember his lines. It was an absolute nightmare",1
" Let me start off by saying the film is an extremely accurate depiction of the life of a gay man. It's not very pleasant. We see our hero, Jamie, in all his depressive moments.<br /><br />We see how miserable he is when he's not drinking. We see how his dreams are crushed. We see how his own family is embarrassed of his",1
" Its nothing you need to rush out and see the second it comes out ,but its watchable and it works well as a movie has a whole . Its just not great , and its not terrible either . I give it a 5 because it was a good acting job but a weak script . It made some good points about being a human and doing the right thing . Many people",1
" It was a pretty good movie. The books are better, but this is a decent adaptation. The animation is really good. The plot is the same as the first book and the teeny tiny bit of the second book. The acting, while I'm not sure it's realistic, is very good. Tyrion's voice is perfect. Jamie has the perfect amount of sound",1
" When I first watched this show my immediate thought was that it had a lot of potential. The acting was superb, Jason Beghe was brilliant as the arrogant and ruthless father and Melora Hardin was fantastic as the snobby mother. I couldn't get enough of them. The show seemed to be great at set up intros for the characters and I thought with a lot",1
" While I've seen every single Bond film in my life, I haven't seen any of them with the commentary on. I've really enjoyed the commentaries, but I had yet to watch them with the film.

" Let me start out by saying this movie is played for laughs. It's supposed to be funny. It's not supposed to be taken seriously. There are some genuinely funny moments and some genuinely scary moments. However, the vast majority of the film is kind of lame. I would recommend seeing it, but don't have high expectations. Know it's campy.<br /",1
" It was the best Rocky movie by far i think. I found it had a great story and that's what makes a movie good for me. Also, i think Apollo Creed did a great job in the film. Because we all know that's not really him. I think he did an excellent job playing a boxer. He had a lot of energy and fire, which is",1
" I had a great time going to the set and meeting both Lee Evans and Bob Pugh. I saw them going into their caravan and just went up and asked them and they said yes so I was really happy. Lee Evans also was very funny and was also very polite, and even signed my script. Its a great film and I would like to see it again and meet",1
" Well , I have to say that it was a pretty good movie . The story line didn't move the way they said it would , but it still was a good movie . It was an interesting look at life in the middle of the '60s . The cast and acting were great ! The only problem I had was that it didn't really get that far into the '",1
 Jack Hawkins is excellent as the police chief. He is mentoring the young policeman played by Peter Cushing. Cushing is a good actor and sort of reminds me of a young Jack Hawkins. There are some gory scenes in this film that deal with dead bodies and a woman that is arrested and dies while in jail. It is sort of a film noir set in,1
" I guess the point of this movie is: Don't mess with the Lone Ranger. If you do, you will suffer the wrath of Tonto. That is mostly what the film is about. I mean it is a John Wayne film and he is the leader. Sure, he is awesome as the Lone Ranger. The part where he falls and gets dragged into the mud by",1
" What a fun little Irish romp. It plays like a one-man show. In fact, it's about the same size as a one-man show. The plot is simple: a man gets a phone call that his wife, the mother of his three kids, has died. He can't tell them. So he makes up an elaborate cover story that she has",1
" This is the way we used to make movies , and I loved listening to Dennis Weaver . A true talent .

 I was looking forward to this film after seeing the American trailer. I was so disappointed. It was low budget with cast of unknowns. The film just didn't do it for me and I am a big fan of teen type films.<br /><br />There wasn't really a plot to it and there was a lot of swearing in it. It was very gritty,1

His first film, THE SNAKE GRAVEYARD (1982), was incredibly groundbreaking, mixing gore and violence with surrealistic imagery, and this film is a continuation of that style. In the style of David Lynch",1
" This is a really great movie. The two leads are good, but the supporting cast is outstanding. The movie is really well directed. It is funny and dramatic at the same time.

 WONDERFUL MOVIE. IT WILL HELP YOU TO SEE LIFE FROM DIFFERENT ANGLE.<br /><br />SO GO AHEAD AND WATCH IT<br />,1
 This film is really boring and slow. This is a very good film but i didn't enjoy much because when i watched it the film was boring and slow. It was a good film but i wanted it to be faster and more interesting because i like action films. It was a good film and i'm sure the film would have been more interesting if it was in English.,1
" This movie is a difficult film to rate. The premise is well-developed and the details are clearly presented, but the personality of the lead character is so villainous that it becomes difficult to feel any sympathy for this man. Also, the movie is very basic, almost boring in some places. The acting is only fair, and Sara Mornell does not measure up to",1

" If you are a fan of movies like DARK CITY, CHILDREN OF MEN and 28 DAYS LATER, then you will like this movie. However, it is not a high-octane, edge-of-your-seat thriller. It is more of a thoughtful, well-paced sci-fi movie. It's not a movie you watch to be",1

 ANOTHER SOLDIER'S STORY is a very valuable film for the insight it offers into the daily life of a black man in the American military. The film is almost documentary like in its glimpse into the lives of black soldiers stationed in Germany in 1985. Director Norman J. Warren's film is very realistic and deals with the problems of these soldiers in a very direct and honest,1
" This war drama takes an unusual approach to the story. Instead of showing the soldiers' life in a combat situation, it concentrates on the long journey back home. The plot covers the closing months of the conflict in 1945 and the long trek home for a group of WWII veterans who have been discharged. The story does an excellent job of illustrating the attempts by the returning soldiers to",1
" A movie about a company of actors. Although the stage is where most of the action takes place, it is not, however, a movie about actors. Rather, the movie is about fame and the toll it exacts upon people. The audience, watching the lives of these people unfold, is privy to the egos that are stroked and the egos that are",1
" A folktale about the meaning of dreams, THE PRINCESS AND THE COBBLER is made from a story from THE ONE HUNDRED AND ONE NIGHTS. It tells the story of a young princess who falls asleep and dreams of a dream in which a poor cobbler asks her for a golden slipper. When she wakes, she has the dream again",1
" A wonderfully realized film that is alternately funny and moving. The film's detailing of the day-to-day lives of the brothers' wives, their neighbors and their children is insightful and heartfelt. The simple joys of family and human interaction are so moving that this film often brought tears to my eyes. Many of the actors are not professional but they are all very talented",1
" The Public Eye is one of the best and most underrated noir films of the 1940s. It is also one of the kindest portraits of a private detective ever created. The 1960s TV series Naked City made a big deal about the ""gritty, urban realism"" of the genre, and generally portrayed the private investigator as a hard-boiled sleuth, full",1
" This is a film that points out just how far one man will go to recover his beloved wife's memory. And how his mind, in the end, is as tortured as his beloved's.

" I think this is an excellent film. I liked the story, I liked the acting, and I liked the music, which in my view is really something in a horror film.

" Having previously watched ""A Place in the Sun"", and seeing some commonalities in both stories, I was prepared for the outcome of ""Bitter Rice"". The movie truly is one of cinema's masterpieces. It is often haunting, as it depicts a simple woman (and the supporting women in her life) who are seduced by the beauty of brown rice. Though the",1
" Having been a fan of The Smiths and Morrissey for some time now, I was, indeed, quite excited to see this film. It had a number of negative reviews which made me a bit hesitant, but I went ahead and rented it anyway. Given my seriousness and devotion to the band and, subsequently, the singer, I am grateful to report that I thoroughly enjoyed",1
" This is a pretty good DVD if you are interested in spies. It includes the BBC documentary ""Double Agent, Kim Philby"" which is worth the price of the DVD alone. But if you just want to see Phillip Seymour Hoffman play a Soviet spy, get ""Red Dragon"" (2002) instead. That's a little more Hollywood, but it's still pretty decent.",1
" I was very pleased with the story. It starts off slowly but really picks up in the second half. The role of John Worthing is filled by Colin Firth, who always is a pleasure to watch. His character is yanked into a mess when his brother is murdered in India, and he is unjustly blamed. His sister, Miss Prism, impersonated by Jud",1
" This movie is in some ways a companion piece to ""Defending Your Life"". It is decidedly more of a comedy than the other, but it too explores the themes of judgment, reincarnation and everyday relationships. In this movie, the hero is confronted with a life where he was a jerk, but also has the chance to be a good person, this time around. A",1

" In the normal course of life, everyone wonders just what will happen to him or her when he or she dies. There are many opinions, and many different answers.

The acting is superb, the scenes are intimate, and you become so involved in the lives of these characters that even the most minor nuance of the plot becomes a significant event. I laughed, I cried, I laughed again, I received goose bumps. I had never heard of this movie, but a friend recommended it to me. I am",1
" THE ASCENT is an amazing film, and the best Soviet film I have seen in a long time. It shows how easy it can be to compromise your principles and ethics, but how difficult to achieve redemption. The film takes place in Nazi occupied Russia, and focuses on a young Russian partisan who is captured by a German patrol. The Nazi officer convinces the Russian to help",1

 I have been watching 'The Sopranos' for a long time now and can not believe that even this episode is so well put together.

 It's hard to believe this movie won an Oscar for Best Film. Most of the movie is spent with a bomb that will go off sometime in the future. The characters are extremely predictable; the ending is a let down. The only reason I would ever recommend this film is if someone wants to see Leonardo DiCaprio in his underwear. DiCaprio is actually a very,1

" An excellent film. The casting was exceptional, and the acting was superb. The story was about the slow deterioration and death of a marriage; and the hell things get to before the actual divorce. What I liked about it, was how they never really said why they would get a divorce - whether it was because of the wife's affair with a much younger man, or because",1
" On a scale of one to ten this film is a twenty. While it's not as clever as the Old Man and the Sea film, nor as expressive as David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia, this film is the next best thing to a good book by P.L. Travers. Its cinematic images capture almost every detail of the story and the infamous Mary Poppins",1

From the opening of the film, you know it is going to be a fast, action packed movie. The opening sequence follows a group of men in a white van chasing after a black sportscar down a crowded city street. The car is filled with drugs",1
 The film is kind of a train wreck. I hesitate to even write about it because I don't want anyone to miss it. It's a nice enough train wreck. It has interesting characters and some fun visuals. A strong cast. And the main problem is that it's so damned slow and dreary. It's a few good scenes with a lot of stupid ones,1
" What a strange movie! It is constantly being influenced by westerns (the woman is dressed like a town, and the man seems to be a descendant of the Lone Ranger, and the music sounds like a western soundtrack, and the hero uses a gun to get his way). Also, the story is always looking for a way to get back onto the wagon trail, and we",1

I was so intrigued by this movie that I asked for it at Christmas. It was a rare movie to find at the time, so that was very special to me. My mother bought it for me and",1
 The film examines the world of children's literature. It is disturbing yet sweet. The children are all adorable. The story is lovely. I would say the very best part is that the innocent world of children's literature is so different from that of adult literature. And I'm not even sure we could find this particular child's viewpoint in adult literature. It is a nice little,1
 A DOUBLE LIFE has developed a mystique among film fans for two reasons: the plot idea of an actor getting so wrapped up into a role (here Othello) as to pick up the great flaw of that character and put it into his life; and that this is the film that won Ronald Colman the Academy Award (as well as the Golden Globe),1
" I am an unabashed fan of spy movies. This is an enjoyable entry in the genre. Robert Vaughn is marvelous as the spy master who won't retire, no matter how old he gets.

I'm sure it'll be a huge seller and will give me (and many others) the chance to see it for the first time or to see it again! It's a great film",1
 This movie is dialogue heavy and is not for everyone. Other than the short Shakespeare plays performed in this movie the rest is dialogue. It's still a great film. The acting is superb. The characters are complex and human. The period costumes are gorgeous. The idea of an extended theater family where the actors actually live there is fascinating. The political intrigue and the show business world,1
" It's since I was a kid that the idea of this movie haunted me. It's the only movie that I dream of. Every night, I talk to my mother in my dream about this movie. I tell her all my secrets in my dream. The reason why I'm writing this review is because I own the movie for around 4 years, but I'm scared to",1
" The best movie I've ever seen. It's a touching, inspiring and funny movie to watch. The characters are actors who play themselves. They are the same actors who play in the TV series ""Scrubs"", ""Gilmore Girls"", and ""Crazy, Stupid, Love."" This movie is very good, really entertaining, and inspiring. You should watch it.",1
" Not all the Best Picture winners are winners. A Streetcar Named Desire was certainly not to me.

Do they entertain me? Do they move me? Do they make",1
" For those of us who love the original, it's worth seeing the remake. And for those of us who love the remake, the original is welcome and well done.

 An utterly charming film that hit me like a ton of bricks. This is one of those movies where you want to tell everyone about it and how much you love it but want to keep it to your own self so as to experience it as often as possible.

 I think this is the first time I ever saw a movie on the big screen. It was pretty cool. ,1

 This is a great movie. It sucks that they won't make the third part. I like the fact that they don't make sequels. ,1

 This is an engrossing movie about a young man who doesn't want to grow up even when he is actually forced to grow up.

 A DOUBLE LIFE has developed a mystique among film fans for two reasons: the plot idea of an actor getting so wrapped up into a role (here Othello) as to pick up the great flaw of that character and put it into his life; and that this is the film that won Ronald Colman the Academy Award (as well as the Golden Globe),1

 The script for the film is more than a little weak but it is what it is. If you like to see a hell of a lot of actors on the screen this is for you. Newcomers will have a blast as will the seasoned movie buff. <br /><br />The film also shows a bit of the techniques used in early filming. A few tricks,1
" I adored this movie, and I'm a bit sad that it has so few reviewseither because it is not classic, or not that much of a ""serious"" movie. I'm not sure though, I think I've seen it pretty late, maybe 8 years ago, maybe even 10. But what I do remember is the feeling it gave me, and that",1
" I watched this movie a long time ago on video and I think I still have a copy of that tape somewhere. Since I came across it on one of the movie channels, I've always been intrigued by it. Couldn't believe I'd never seen it before. In a nutshell, this is a film about a person who goes about his (her?) life keeping the",1
" This was the best Red Dwarf yet! ""D.N.A."" has a plot that can only be described as bizarre, but is so good that you don't care! ""D.N.A."" has the crew of the ""Red Dwarf"" searching for a cure for a virus infection that turns the infected into mechanoids (i.e. robots). This",1
" OK, I was expecting a gross and outragoeous movie, but it was not. Sure there is a lot of nudity and blood, but it is a cool movie. If you are looking for a good movie that is a little dark and has a weird story line, then you should check out this one. I would recommend it to anyone that has a good understanding",1
" This is a hilarious movie. A mix of funny and gratuitous violence. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the movie, the basic premise is that a Mexican wrestler is accused of being a half-breed (half-indian) and is forced to leave Mexico. In his travels, he ends up in (pre-revolutionary) France where his fighting skills",1
" I saw the original 40+ years ago, and can still remember how grossed out I was by it. That's likely to happen when a main character has an eye shoved into his brain. Today, you have to go out of your way to find something that's repulsive, so I was really surprised that ",1
" FUNNY PEOPLE follows a comic named George Simmons (Adam Sandler). In his day he was big, but in recent years, he is getting nowhere. Sure he still has his loyal audience, but it is not like before. He even has been fired from an opening gig after he complains about the crowd talking during his act. Then, one day, he learns he has",1
" Before there was The Matrix, there was Terminator. And The Terminator is a far better movie than The Matrix. The Terminator is basically your basic action movie. There's no deepness to the plot. There's no hidden symbolism happening. It's just a simple, dumb, action movie. But it's a damn good one. This is the movie that the first Matrix movie",1
" I just watched ""The Full Monty"" for the second time, and I was again struck by how great the movie really is (except for the musical scene, which is absolutely horrible). I'd give it the full five stars but I have one complaint. I think it's a crime that the excellent song that the group performed at the Edinburgh Fringe (""Loving Souls",1
" It's awesome. It's the last episode of Futurama ever, and it's the best. The plot is well written, the animation is smooth and clear, the humorous is hilarious, and the very end is a little tear-jerker. It's also the longest episode in Futurama's history, with 4 acts and an epilogue. The show",1
" I won't go into needless details. This movie is great. It is not overrated. It is not overhyped. This movie gives me a great feeling every time I watch it. I watch it again and again from time to time. It is well made - everything is perfect. Yes, it is sentimental. It is sentimental as hell. Sometimes it is so",1
" If you want to study animation, you'd better watch them all! Imagine that some guy is writing reviews on animated movies, but he's never seen any of them before? That's why I'm writing this. I saw this movie recently and I decided to give it a try. Well, I can't say that I'm going to watch other films of this series,",1
 Jack Nicholson said it well: The a movie about the American revolution is priceless. The rest of the movie is not bad either. ,1
" I'm a die hard Lost fan, so I can say I'm biased. But, you can't deny the quality that is Lost. Great acting, great plot, and great characters. Although there are some unanswered questions, the unanswered questions make the show great. It leaves you always wanting to know more, and wanting to figure out the mysteries. The best part of the",1
 A very traditional movie with an excellent story. I was very impressed with the acting of the characters. The plot was wonderful and the flow was very good. The music was very good and fit the theme. The camera work was beautiful and very smooth. I was very impressed by the movie and I would recommend it to anyone. ,1
" Being a classic myself, ""A Star Is Born"" is a great movie!! The vocals of Judy Garland are beautiful, and the movie's plot is great! Right from the start of the movie it is interesting and very good. The chemistry between Judy Garland and James Mason is sizzling and is an essential part of the movie. This movie is a must have in every",1
" The opening scene of the movie was like going back to the original ""Mission Impossible."" I just loved it! (Maybe not the music but that's just me) The rest of the movie was a very good spy movie, but nowhere near as good as the first Mission Impossible. I remember waiting for a long time for this movie to come out and I was so disappointed with",1
" In an era of over-the-top overblown action movies, this refreshingly small-scale film is a welcome relief. The story is set in the world of everyday politics, but is filled with humour and a keen insight. Damon and Reed have great chemistry and play off each other well. This is a film that keeps you hooked until the last minute of the film",1
" This is the best concert video ever! I have it on VHS (Region 2) but after watching the dvd I'm not sure that I'll bother hunting down a copy of the video. I live in Australia and we don't get a lot of new releases on here. I can't wait for the DVD of the Pulse concert to be released, I read that",1
" Superb screen adaptation of the Melville classic. The film's focus is entirely on Captain Ahab (Gregory Peck), and his obsession with revenge. There's no evangelical moralizing. When he makes his famous ""meanest shark"" speech, his fury is primal. We all know that Ahab's quest is doomed, but he has made his choice, and he",1
" It has been a long time since I've seen this movie, and I left the cinema with a sense of disappointment. I couldn't help thinking how much better it could have been. In the original screenplay, we are introduced to a Batman who already has had years of crime fighting under his belt. His fighting style was much more developed. His costume was more sinister and intimidating",1
" I should start by saying that I don't read alot of books, or at least not many books written in the last century. I tried reading Fitzgerald and Waugh in high school and it was excruciating. I figured I'd give S. my best shot, since it's been so highly recommended for so long. I'm afraid I can't give it much of a recommendation",1
" I'm a little biased as I have a thing for animated French movies, but this one has to be one of the best. The animation is absolutely breathtaking, and the story is fascinating. If you love animation, or a good story you need to see this. It is an amazing film. ",1
 WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? DO U WANT ME TO CRY? U WANT ME TO SMILE? DO U WANT ME TO TAKE YOU TO DINNER WITH ME AND MY MOM? DO U WANT ME TO BE HAPPY? DO U WANT ME TO BE SAD? DO U WANT ME TO STOP LAUGHING MY @$$ OFF?,1
" I will say that I found the movie to be a bit difficult to understand. It jumps from point of view to point of view and the narration is very believable and authentic, but it too jumps around, so it's hard to follow what's going on. But I give the movie a 5 because of the intense emotion that is present throughout the whole film. This movie will",1
" It is very rare for me to give this many stars to a movie! This is an enjoyable movie if you like a good B-movie. I have to get my hands on the rest of the series. I really liked the effects in this movie, and it has John Carpenter's weirdness all over it! I give it a ten, hands down! ",1
" The Godfather is an incredible masterpiece. It's the best movie ever. Whenever I see it, it always brings back memories of after-school and high school days, including the popcorn, drinking a cold drink, and my godfather, who is deceased now, but I remember him telling me, ""I love you son."" I was in the 7th grade and I",1
" From the first ten minutes, the movie delves into a hilariously dark world of the apocalypse, where the protagonist, Bill Murray, is trying to rescue his daughter from the clutches of the devil. I loved the overall satanic theme of the film, with the devil's best henchman, Nick Cage, conspiring against Bill Murray at every turn. By the time",1
" It's hard to say what I liked most about this movie. The characters are very well developed and despite the lack of dialogue, manage to communicate their emotions and intentions with obvious body language and looks. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good comedy/drama. ",1
" When it comes to making movies based on some of the most famous comic book heros of all time, Hollywood has a virtual monopoly and doesn't show any signs of giving it up any time soon. 20th Century Fox is responsible for three of the best by far: ""Superman"", ""Spider-Man"", and ""X-Men"". This is despite the fact that",1
" If there's one thing more boring than watching a group of people try to make a movie out of Harry Potter, it's watching a group of people try to make a movie out of Harry Potter based on a script written by someone who hasn't read the books. This is my review of ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" which is the sequel to the movie """,1
" Wow, I don't know if i've ever seen a movie that sucked so bad. The director/writer/star/producer/editor/caterer must have spent about 15 minutes making this movie. It's like it was made by a few morons that got together and took the first bunch of script they could find and made a movie with it. It",1
" I don't know why, but I just watched this film again, right before Christmas. What a great film!<br /><br />I'm not sure why I like this film so much. The music is great, as always (Mark Knopfler always has something wonderful to offer). The story is very interesting. I like the characters. The scenery is",1
" It's hard to compile a list of the best movies of 2000 without mentioning ""Requiem for a Dream"".<br /><br />The movie is a masterpiece of filmmaking, a horrifying, realistic look at drug addiction. The acting is splendid, with Ellen Burstyn turning in a performance that won her an Academy Award. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly are also excellent",1
" I'm not sure if it's a mockumentary or not- I've just seen that there are at least two actors who were cast in ""This is Spinal Tap"" playing similar roles in this film. ""Spinal tap"" is one of my all time favorites, so maybe that's why I enjoyed this film so much. And it does make you laugh out",1
" Having read the enormous amount of negative reviews surrounding this film, I think I can safely say that it was a great movie. It was a dark, emotional, experimental film that really did keep you on the edge of your seat. I think it's a great testament to the movie that I found myself actually caring about the characters and their fate. I think viewers who watch this",1
" In terms of action blockbusters, I must've seen a dozen or more, and I'm convinced that the best ones are those that manage to deliver everything in one package: drive, excitement, suspense, thrills, action, special effects and, of course, a plot that makes sense. I'm also convinced, however, that this is a pretty hard combination to get",1
" This was the first of the early ""Buster"" shorts, and it's a full-on ""comic"" short... and a comedic masterpiece... I can't think of any cartoon that can surpass it in sheer laughter... I will try to share why I think this is so, and suggest that this is not only the best of the ""Buster"" shorts,",1
" I just got back from the movie theater. I bought the ticket for this movie yesterday because I wanted to see it, but at the same time I was kind of nervous and afraid of what it would be like. I had to drive to the theater in a hurry so I didn't have much time to think things through. I didn't want to be disappointed, but I",1
" I'm sure the people who love this film are genuine fans, but I find it hard to understand why this is a masterpiece. I watched the movie because again, I'm a fan of the comic book. The movie was not that moving, not that interesting, and not that fun. I looked at the casting, and most of the actors, while talented, could not",1
" Every time the so-called ""real"" world and my fantasy world collide successfully, the movie we'll be talking about on Saturday is ""The Lord of the Rings."" I didn't care much for the way this flabby old franchise was forced back into action, but the two films are excellent and exemplary of how to do a fantasy ""high fantasy"" movie. (I",1
" I'm a little surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. From the reaction of other critics it seems that I'm in the minority. I think the acting is very good and the characters don't seem contrived. Even if you don't like the film, you can't deny that it's well made and professional. It's a complex movie, but the characters and",1
" Uwe Boll is a controversial figure. He's co-scripted the over-the-top action movie ""Rampage,"" in which a giant ape takes on an army of giant wolfs and gators. He's also responsible for ""Alone in the Dark,"" a film based on a video game about a guy who wanders around in a dark house looking",1
" There's one word I could use to sum up this movie - ""innocent"". I'm not gonna sit here, and point out the plot holes and inconsistencies, because I wasn't expecting anything from this movie. Before I watched this film on dvd, I saw the trailer, and I thought to myself - ""Wow! This looks like a really sweet film!"" And",1
" I'll hate the day that I have to say the following, but Kevin Smith is back to his usual antics. That's right, the guy was so wacko, hysterically funny and also extremely talented when he first started out with Clerks. I loved the movie, even though it was shot in black-and-white and was almost entirely dialogue-driven",1
" And you thought American History X was brutal. Here's one that's even a little more daring.<br /><br />This is a harsh, gritty, violent revenge flick. Sure, I know it's a cartoon and I know it's a lot of steps removed from reality, but even so, it's a lot. It's a movie with a very, very",1
" Japanese Anime, along with the ""Star Wars"" movies and ""The Matrix"" trilogy, will forever be the most influential films in the world to me. The Anime has beautiful graphics, compelling story lines, and a diversity of different kinds of animation. In this film, I personally found the story lines to be very real and very interesting. <br /><br />One",1
" I can't say I'm a huge fan of biopics, which is a good thing because I'm pretty sure this would have been one of the ones I'd fall in love with. Featuring a cast of people I've grown up with and adore, it's a well made and highly entertaining piece of filmmaking. Yes, the performances are solid, and I don't",1
" The idea of the story is great and the story itself is good, but the movie is a little bit too light, and kind of boring for me. I know that it's a fantasy movie, but things are a little bit too childish to me... The ending is without a doubt the worst thing about this movie, it's really really really boring. I think Spil",1
